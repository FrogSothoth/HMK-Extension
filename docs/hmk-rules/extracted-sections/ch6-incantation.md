# Incantation

## Incantation

Incantation is the arcane mystery that allows for the direct channelling of ethereal energy into the world. Some incanters inherit an arcane talent to do so. These arcanists are called invokers , and they are likely the oldest tradition. Known colloquially as hedge witches or warlocks , invokers also number many among the Ælrhin (elves).

However, most incanters learn spellcasting through arduous study, itself still requiring a high level of natural affinity. They employ verbal cant and physical gesture to express the magic as a spell or in an object as an enchantment. Such arcanists are mages , the most widespread example of whom are members of an organisation called the Shek-Pvar.

## Shèk-Pvâr

The origins of the Ancient and Esoteric Orders of the Shek-Pvar are clouded in the prehistoric past. Recent scholarship postulates their roots in ancient Molkura, a realm located along the extreme southern edge of eastern Lythia. Also called The Weirding Land, the area developed a mysterious pyramid culture over 7000 years ago, but the Shek-Pvar might have emerged out of scholars studying an even older, primordial civilisation called the Earthmasters.

## earthmasters

Very little is known of the Earthmasters. They arrived on Kethira about 20,000 years ago and abruptly left 5000 years later. Their best-known legacy are strange artefacts and ruins scattered throughout all three continents of the world. Whether the Molkuran genesis proves true, early mages likely learned much of their lore from studying these relics. Most also believe they were greatly influenced by another ancient group-the Ælrhin (elven-folk).

## ælrhin

Millennia after the disappearance of the Earthmasters, about 10,000 years ago, a people believed to be leaving strife on another world settled on Kethira. These Ælrhin brought with them a natural ability for magic, especially that dealing with nature, music, dance, and craft. The most prominent among them-the Sinai of the island of Hârnvery likely provided much of the foundation for the growth of the Pvaric philosophy of spellcasting.

## pvâric philosophy

Whether released through natural talent, performed as a spell, or accessed through an artefact, the forces that manifest arcane power reside within the foundations of Kelestia (Reality) itself. How this came to be is unknown. The mages of the Shek-Pvar connect themselves to these ethereal energies through the strength of their own Aura. With study and practice they may eventually shape them to their will. This general philosophy is called Pvarism.

A Pvarist perceives Kelestia primarily in terms of six principle energies : Earth, Metal, Fire, Air, Aura, and Water. This view does not reductively hold that the universe is somehow only composed of just these basic elementsthere are, in fact, other principles. However, given the rigours exacted through the study of this reality, mages have discovered that any single being can more easily master Pvarism through initial focus on one of these six elemental principles. Ultimately, this does not preclude studying others: the greatest achievement is the mastery of all six and the transformation into a grey mage.

## Convocations

Pvarism assigns the study of each elemental principle to its own sub-order called a convocation . Each convocation has its own name, associated hue, principle energy focus (also called its element), and sundry associated principles:

| Fývria   | Earth   | Life • Death • Growth • Decay             |
|----------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| Jmôrvi   | Metal   | Mineral • Artifice • Substance • Toxicity |
| Pèleáhn  | Fire    | Heat • Dryness • Smoke•Action             |
| Lyáhvi   | Air     | Light • Illusion • Incorporeality • Sound |
| Sàvôrya  | Aura    | Knowledge • Mind• Emotion • Keléstia      |
| Odívshè  | Water   | Cold • Darkness • Silence • Stasis        |

At the outset of training, the mage attunes to the element of a single convocation, thereby making the study of others more difficult. The relationship among the convocations is spectral-while core differences are fairly clear, the margins separating them become blurred, and perhaps, on the finest level, nearly impossible to distinguish. Symbols of the six convocations have traditionally been configured in a circle, called the Pvaric Wheel (page 196).

## convocation affinity

The convocation to which a Shek-Pvar attunes is called the Primary convocation; the two adjacent to this one on the Pvaric Wheel are called Secondary convocations; the two further adjacent to these, Tertiary ; and the last, sixth oneopposite the first-the Diametric . This relative 'position' among the six is called convocation affinity.

There are also a host of other principles not under the aegis of the six convocations-all of these are grouped under the name Neutral magic, and, conceptually, reside in the middle of the Wheel. All Shek-Pvar study Neutral magic with the same relative amount of difficulty.

## the pvâric wheel

When symbolised in the Pvaric Wheel, the convocations are configured as shown below. While its origin is unknown, this pattern has been interpreted as depicting the two elements 'beneath the ground' at the bottom of the wheel (earth and metal); the two elements 'in the heavens' at the top of the wheel (soul and air); and the two 'at the surface' in the middle (water and fire). The grey centre represents Neutral. The ordering of table rows and columns throughout the book, such as seen on the previous and following pages, lists the six Pvaric convocations in their corresponding Sunsign sequence: Fyvria first (Ulandus/spring/start of year), and Odivshe last (Lado/winter/end of year). If included, Neutral is on a table's bottom row.

## sàvôrya

Savorya is the magic of soul-the true nature of living, corporeal entities. At its core, Savorya deals with Aura, the strength of an organism's connection to the soul. They study knowledge, thought and concept, as well as emotion and feelings-all facets of the mind. A Savoryan has the greatest understanding of innate magic-use (Arcane Talents) and often claims to have penetrated the greatest complexities of reality itself.

## odívshè

Odivshe is the magic of water-cool and slow, the very opposite of heat and action. Odivshe mages manipulate the cold, including how it interacts with water to form ice and snow. They also study the opposite of light and fire, namely darkness and gloom and their consequencesstasis and silence, whether literally, as in an absence of sound, or figuratively, as in the guise of secrets, the hidden knowledge not far from Savoryan revelation.

## fývria

Fyvria is the magic of the earth-green and growing, yet also pale and dying. Its mages manipulate the cycles of growth and decay that underlie all of the natural world. At the Fyvrian core is fertile earth where life both swarms and ceases to be. Fyvrians use life- and death-symbols as foci (wooden staves, bags of earth, skulls). None of these attest to either a 'goodness' or an 'evil' in nature-that distinction emerges from the mage's own heart.

## lyáhvi

Lyahvi is the magic of air-swift and ambiguous; bright and sterile. Lyahvi mages manipulate light (reflection and refraction), often to confuse and distract with illusions. They master the incorporeal and the absence or overcoming of body, as in dematerialisation (the body-notthere). Although sound, by definition, propagates through other mediums, a Lyahvi Shek-Pvar controls its most common avenue through the air.

## pèleáhn

Peleahn is the magic of fireactive and destructive, quick and uncaring. A Peleahn mage manipulates heat and smoke, along with fire, to produce pyrotechnic effects. In basic opposition to Odivshe's water principle, the Peleahn incanter also manipulates dryness. Finally, at the core of much of Peleahn effects is the volatile and potent nature of energy and sustained action.

## jmôrvi

Jmorvi is the magic of metal-powerful, unyielding, but occasionally brittle. Its magic tends to be more methodical, even slow, especially with a focus on metal arms and armour artefact creation and object manipulation: it is the convocation of smiths. In dealing with minerals of all kinds, and the residual effluents of their workings, the Jmorvi mage often faces, and even learns to control, toxic and acidic side-effects.

## neutral

Neutral magic involves either principles not explained within one of the six convocations, or effects that require several principles at once. All Shek-Pvar handle Neutral spells with equal competence, and many of its spells manipulate the castings of the other convocational spells. So-called 'grey' magic expresses a wide variety of power, including artefact creation, dimensionality, and shapechanging.

## organisation

The Guild of Arcane Lore is the loose association of those who practice the arcane mysteries, including invokers, mages, alchemists, diviners, and other 'mystics'. Chartered less than two hundred years ago, the Guild now has chapters in nearly every region of Lythia (above right). The much older Shek-Pvar are six separate organisations within this greater guild, each dedicated to the pursuit of its associated convocational magic (below right). While a Shek-Pvar mage might reside at Arcane Lore chapters, the other arcanist types are usually relegated to them, not often residing permanently at a Pvaric chantry.

## Chantries

Chantries are places where members study, learn, and practice their arcane art, with convocational chantries often quite secluded. All are administered by a seneschal (a steward who is not necessarily a mage) and a support staff of apprentices and a few brave servants. While masters routinely live within a specific home chantry, they are usually welcome at all for brief stays during their travels.

The Major Lythian Chantries table displays four pieces of information.

Realm : the general realm or specific kingdom where the chapter resides.

Name : the settlement after which the chapter is named, although often some distance from the settlement itself.

Quality : the rating on a five-star scale. This affects certain tests, such as Spell Research Rolls.

Masters ( m ) : the number of resident masters. Usually there are a like number of associated, itinerant journeymen, and two to three times the number of apprentices.

## minor chantries

In addition to the hundred major chantries given in the table, there are also about a hundred chantries with fewer than eight (8) resident masters. These minor chantrieswhether Arcane Lore or the six convocational-usually have quality ratings of one or two stars.

## special chantries

The Arcane Lore chantries at Emelrene/Hedegu, Molkura/ Kotyn, and Hacherdad/Hacherdad-shown in italics in the Arcane Lore section of the table-are actually single complexes that also house all six Shek-Pvar convocations.

## major venârivè chantry locations

Map locations of the chantries in Venarive are shown on the first pages of each of the Convocational spell listings: Fyvria (page 213), Jmorvi (page 219), Peleahn (page 225), Lyahvi (page 231), Savorya (page 237), and Odivshe (page 243). The Arcane Lore chapters are shown on the first page of the Grey mysteries (page 249).

## joining the shèk-pvâr

A player character must usually begin the campaign already a Shek-Pvar. Paramount is the character's Aura score, although Reason and Will also contribute to success. Despite even powerful social connections, characters with an SB lower than 13 are not likely to become members. Although possession of more than one natural Arcane Talent-especially Natural Attunement-would almost assure acceptance, the GM and player ultimately decide whether a character qualifies.

A Shek-Pvar may be of any age, just like any other character. Young mages usually start out the campaign as Satia Mavari (page 199), but especially talented onesor those benefiting from Pvarist parents-might have progressed more quickly. Players can also begin the game with Mature and Old Shek-Pvar of higher rank, but they should be aware of the complexity involved. Simply follow the regular generation rules in Chapter 2: Character , paying special attention to the section on page 54.

Shek-Pvar almost invariably begin training as adolescents, but, in a sufficiently long campaign, the GM might allow astoundingly talented Young characters to start after the game begins. Simply follow the rules for skill development in Chapter 8: Campaign (page 413) to acquire the same array of skills in Chapter 2: Character .

## Pvârism Skill

However and whenever attained, Pvarism ML establishes the character's ability in two distinct magical enterprises:

Spellcasting : casting learned spells (page 200).

Spell Research : learning and inventing spells (page 205).

## Convocational Attunement

A Shek-Pvar becomes attuned to a single convocation, called the Primary convocation. This is the only convocation to which the character will ever be attuned -unless and until the status of Grey Mage is attained. The specific chantry where this attunement and initial training takes place is assigned by the GM or selected by the player.

It is assumed that those with the Shek-Pvar occupation have already attuned to their Primary convocation by the end of character generation. For a character who starts training during the campaign, treat the process of attunement as if it were Spell Research (page 205) with a 10 Difficulty but no chance of Spell Misfire. Attunement usually starts at the end of the second year of training, immediately upon attaining SM1 in Pvarism skill.

## convocation sunsign modifier

Pvarism is greatly affected by astrology. Each convocation receives a sunsign modifier based upon the character's sunsign. If on a cusp, the mage uses the more positive (less negative) modifier between the given two sunsigns:

## sunsign modifier

| sunsign     |   f´yvria |   jmôrvi |   pèleáhn |   lyáhvi |   sàvôrya |   odívshè |
|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|

| Angberélius |        -5 |       +5 |       +15 |       +5 |        -5 |       -15 |

| Hîrin       |       -15 |       -5 |        +5 |      +15 |        +5 |        -5 |
| Táræl       |       -10 |      -10 |         0 |      +10 |       +10 |         0 |
| Tai         |        -5 |      -15 |        -5 |       +5 |       +15 |        +5 |
| Skôrus      |         0 |      -10 |       -10 |        0 |       +10 |       +10 |
| Masâra      |        +5 |       -5 |       -15 |       -5 |        +5 |       +15 |
| Ládo        |       +10 |        0 |       -10 |      -10 |         0 |       +10 |

The sunsign modifier for Neutral spells is always 0 for all mages, regardless of the sunsign of their birth.

## convocation ml

A mage has an ML in each of the seven convocations equal to Pvarism ML adjusted by the convocation's sunsign modifier:

## convocation ml = pvarism ml + sunsign modifier

Each resulting sum of Pvarism ML and sunsign modifier is a Convocation Mastery Level (ML)-not EML-because Sunsign is an inherent, permanent effect on Pvaric spellcasting. While a player may note these seven MLs on the character sheet, the mage will only gradually learn spells from them according to their Pvarism ML, starting with their Primary convocation (Spell Research, page 205).

Example : a mage born under the Tai sunsign has attuned to Savorya as the Primary convocation. With Pvarism ML84, the mage has the following Convocation MLs

| Savorya (Primary)   | ML99(84+15)   |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Odivshe (Secondary) | ML89(84+5)    |
| Lyahvi (Secondary)  | ML89(84+5)    |
| Neutral             | ML84(84+0)    |
| Fyvria (Tertiary)   | ML79(84-5)    |
| Peleahn (Tertiary)  | ML79(84-5)    |
| Jmorvi (Diametric)  | ML69(84-15)   |

Once the game begins, the character only has to develop Pvarism skill, either through Experience Points (XP) or Skill Development Rolls (SDR), as explained on page 413. Each such improvement in Pvarism ML automatically improves all of the mage's Convocation MLs. Thus, if the Shek-Pvar in the above example improves Pvarism ML84 to ML85, then Savorya automatically improve to ML100, Odivshe goes to ML90, Lyahvi increases to ML90, and so forth for the other convocations as well.

Note : see also the Spell ML Development Option (page 349).

## Ranks

Shek-Pvar mages are ascribed to one of four ranks, largely a measure of expertise, especially at the lower levels. The following table shows a progression for a mage of some talent (SB15); the explanations following it also note the points by which given Pvarism SM are usually attained.

| rank        | status            | years   | pvarismml   |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| Mavâr       | Apprentice        | 1-6     | 10-49       |
| Satía Mavâr | Senior Apprentice | 7-12    | 50-69       |
| Shenâva     | Journeyman        | 13-24   | 70-89       |
| Vîrán       | Master            | 25+     | 90+         |

Bring not the scorn of the Kvikir upon thy Puâric family, nor

## mavâr

During the first couple years of study, a Hanmavar (halfapprentice) assumes important, yet mostly mundane, tasks-attending lectures, practicing scripts, meditating. The new apprentice does not learn spells but does begin formal training in Pvarism, usually becoming attuned to a Primary convocation by the end of the third year (SM1). Then, upon demonstrating adequate worth to advance, the novice is formally bound to a specific Viran mentor for actual arcane study, becoming a Mavar (SM2).

Over the next few years, the Mavar begins assisted research in Primary convocation spells (SM3). Near the end of apprenticeship, the master teaches the Mavar the Neutral spells Detect, Reveal, and Dispel.

## satía mavâr

Upon reaching a fair level of competence (SM4)-after about seven years-students leave their masters as Satia Mavari (senior apprentices). They are sent forth from the chantry to test and refine their arcane art. Customarily, such travels last for at least a year and often up to five or more years. Satia Mavari are effectively 'journeymen', wandering the world and undertaking great adventures.

## shenâva

After surviving the outside world, the Satia Mavar might attain the next, and usually highest, rank of Shenava (journeyman). Such promotion can require the Satia Mavar to demonstrate three unique spells and bequeath their chantry three artefacts of note. If accepted by a panel of masters, the Satia Mavar becomes a Shenava, a true independent who develops mainly through solitary effort (SM5). Eventual study of Tertiary and Diametric Convocations will still likely require a chantry's resources.

## vîrán

Only the most proficient and prominent Shenava achieves the rank of Viran (master). It demands decades of work and an official nomination by peers in a document called a Petition of Excellence . Virana train Mavari, and most who achieve its rank remain cloistered at a chantry, finishing off their careers where they began.

ARCANE MYSTERIES

SHÈK-PVÂR

## Laws

While good and evil mages could both exist in any convocation, members are all unified by the common pursuit of Pvaric magic. They view their fellow Pvarist brothers and sisters as a family clearly distinct from ordinary folk (whom they call Kvikîr ). Upon acceptance as a mavar, members throughout all of Kethira formally commit oaths to the five Laws of the Shek-Pvar.

## Shèk-Pvâr Laws

## Law of Humility

Bring	not	the	scorn	of	the	Kvikîr	upon	thy	Pvâric	family,	nor make with thyne art a place for thyself above them.

## Law of Secrecy

Spread	not	thy	lore,	even	among	thy	Pvâric	family,	without sanction of thy peers.

## Law of Peace

Keep sacred and free from harm thy house of lore.

## Law of Security

Succour not renegades of the art, but strike them down with thy power,	else	summon	Pvâric	family	to	thyne	aid.

## Law of Charity

Make tithe to thy house a portion of thyne arcane treasure to thy Pvâric	family's	benefit.

## renegades

The Shek-Pvar self-police any who violate these oaths. A member who in the opinion of six or more Virana harms the interests of a convocation in other ways can also be declared renegade . While they do have a chance to recant and mend their transgressions, such outcasts very likely lose membership. Note, however, the renegade loses only status-not their arcane power.

a

## guild of arcane lore ranks

The Shek-Pvar are branch organisations within the larger Guild of Arcane Lore, which itself includes alchemists, astrologers, runecasters, 'sorcerers' (talent users), and even some mystics such as shamans. Perhaps to highlight this separation, Pvarists retain an older nomenclature for the middle guild ranks that differs from the younger, parent guild's practice.

While both organisations describe new students or apprentices as Mavari, the Guild of Arcane Lore next awards its non-Pvarist journeymen (or 'bachelors') the title Satia ; and then its 'masters', the rank Shenava . While both use the term Viran for the most exalted status, such members of the Guild of Arcane Lore are addressed as 'doctor' or 'Academian'.

## pvâric magic

Pvaric spellcasting consists of two core concepts: Form and Principle . At spellstart, the mage begins creating the Form that defines the intended effect and then, at spellfire, channels the Principle-the raw ethereal energy-into their own body to 'fill' the Form.

A properly created Form empowered with the right amount of channelled Principle produces the spell's effect. A spell cast indefinitely or permanently on an object is called an enchantment , making it an arcane artefact .

Pvaric spellcasting requires the channelling of ethereal energy from the spirit world into a mage's body in the physical world. This is not possible if the body is dematerialised or if the caster inhabits the spirit world.

## spell mastery level

Mages compute a Spell Mastery Level (ML) for each of their spells. This equals Convocation ML minus twice Spell Difficulty:

## spell ml = convocation ml - difficulty × 2

Convocation ML equals Pvarism ML plus the Sunsign Modifier of the convocation to which the spell belongs (page 198).

Difficulty equals the sum of the spell's Complexity Level (CL) and Convocation Degree (CD). Spells have a Complexity Level from one to six (I to VI), from easier, less powerful spells to more difficult and impactful ones.

A spell's Convocation Degree is 0 to 4, derived from the mage's affinity with the convocation to which the spell belongs:

| affinity   |   cd | pvaricwheelposition   |
|------------|------|-----------------------|
| Primary    |    0 | Attuned Convocation   |
| Secondary  |    1 | Onestep away          |
| Neutral    |    2 | Centre                |
| Tertiary   |    3 | Twosteps away         |
| Diametric  |    4 | Three steps away      |

Spell Index equals the ML divided by ten, rounded down (like other skills). It is uniquely abbreviated as SI throughout the rules.

Example : a mage with the Tai Sunsign has Pvarism ML84 and Savorya as Primary convocation. When casting Lyahvi spells, the Sunsign Modifier is +5, as shown in the table on page 198. The mage has Lyahvi Convocation ML89 (Pvarism ML84 + 5).

If the mage knows the Secondary convocation spell called Caecity (Lyahvi III), then Spell Difficulty equals 4 (CL3 + CD1). The penalty to spell ML is twice this sum (-8), resulting in Caecity Spell ML81 (Lyahvi Convocation ML89 - 8), and SI8.

## spellcasting routine

A mage follows four steps to cast a spell:

| [�] Spell Modifiers ...........................................................   | page ���   |
| [�] Casting Roll ...............................................................  | page ���   |
| [�] Casting Fatigue ..........................................................    | page ���   |

## [ � ] Declaration

## [�.�] spellstart

Using the Incant action option, the mage selects a spell and begins casting-this is called spellstart. The caster must concentrate during the spell's casting time up through completing the Casting Roll (step 3). See page 182 for a discussion of what prevents and breaks concentration, forcing the caster to Abort the spell (step 1.2).

## [�.�] casting options

Concurrent with spellstart, the caster chooses any spell variables (see Attenuate, below). Casters may also consider the four other Casting Options, some of which apply later to a spell already cast:

| abort     | After spellstart, the magedecides to or is forced to end the casting before spellfire. To doso, the caster makesthe sameCasting Roll as if the casting were carried to spellfire (the roll ismadeatthe momentthespell is ended and is not considered an action).ACF Spell Misfire is still possible-but all other success levelsmeanthe spell has noeffect and the caster accrues 5 less fatigue than the resulting Casting Roll would normally inflict in step 4 (page 202).                |

## [2] Spell Modifiers

Modify the caster's Spell ML by any of the following applicable factors. The result equals Spell EML .

## [�.�] cant

The verbal element of casting a spell, called the cant, consists of two parts-a receptacle and an incant. The receptacle describes the spell's process and effect and is a model of the spell's Form. The incant is a

is impairment penalties, but ies. Grievous impairment

on (or to both arms)

chnique, but ent casting

not.

se uS,

unique, nonsensical-sounding utterance that conjures the Principle. Thus, the caster speaks the receptacle to create the Form during casting Time; then utters the incant to summon the Principle at spellfire.

Silent Cant : casters may say the cant silently to themselves at a -10 penalty to Spell EML.

## [�.�] gesture

Spells also have a gestural routine during their casting Time. This can include movements of the hands, arms, head, and whole body, the latter emphasised in dance-magic traditions. Two factors can affect gesture.

Encumbered Gesture : casters have a penalty to Spell EML equal to their Encumbrance.

Still Gesture : casters remain motionless at a -10 penalty. This still gesture penalty replaces any incurred by Encumbrance.

## [�.�] noise

Spellcasting requires concentration and so usually takes place with very little surrounding noise to disturb it.

Loud Noise : casters distracted by strident nearby sounds-such as shouting or the clamour of melee-have a -10 penalty to Spell EML.

## [�.�] fatigue &amp; injury impairment

Fatigue and Minor and Serious impairment to the Head and Torso zones penalise Spell EML. Mages can employ the Still Gesture to replace Minor and Serious impairment penalties, but fatigue penalty always applies. Grievous impairment in any Head or Torso location (or to both arms) requires the Still Gesture technique, but Grievous skull injuries prevent casting altogether, whether Still or not.

## [�.5] other modifiers

Include modifiers from these miscellaneous sources: Focus, Jointed Casting, Object Element, Place, Quicken, and Grimoire (see sidebar).

<!-- image -->

## other modifiers

Focus : an elemental Focus grants a bonus to Primary convocation spellcasting and half the same amount to Secondary convocation spells. The bonus varies by Focus ML (page 252).

Joined Casting : mages who know the same spell may cast it together if they touch at least one other person involved. Joined casting functions like skill assistance (page 60). One primary mage makes the Casting Roll, and is the only one to suffer Spell Misfire. Casting fatigue increases by 5 when Joined, shared out between casters in equal quantities of 5 (primary caster receives odd amounts).

Object Element : certain spells cast on an object have a modifier according to the convocation affinity between the spell and the object :

| p +0   | s -10   | n -15   | t -20   | d -30   |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|

Neutral spells have a 0 modifier on all objects.

Example : a mage casts a Peleahn spell on a metal sword, a Jmorvi object. This is Secondary affinity, and so a -10 penalty applies to the Casting Roll.

Place : some spells (such as the Neutral IV spell Sanctum) and natural places (such as ethereal zones) grant a casting bonus based upon the infused magical energy of the place itself.

Quicken : with casting times measured in rounds, a mage may deduct one round at a -20 penalty to the Casting Roll. A 1-round time becomes a Free action. The mage can only quicken once per casting, decided at spellstart.

Grimoire : mages who reference their grimoire (page 205) while casting a known spell with a time of 4 rounds or less receive +10 bonus. However, casting time is measured in minutes , not rounds (a Free action time takes 6 rounds).

## elemental objects

Some spells require Shek-Pvar to possess, or reward them for having, an elemental object. This can be either a mundane or an enchanted physical object that embodies their Primary convocational principles and weighs less than half their Spirit ML in pounds. The first page of a convocation's section gives examples of such objects, each usually small or easily carried. The mage may only establish a link with it through Proximate Attunement, which includes the chance for Contact Loss (page 208).

## elemental focus

An elemental focus is an elemental object the mage enchants with the Focus spell (Neutral III). A focus serves as an elemental object when called for, and, otherwise, enhances Primary and Secondary spellcasting (step 2.5, above).

## spellfire initiative rank

Step 4 of the Combat Routine (page 160) explains how Action Time is sequenced. Spellstart begins on the caster's Initiative Rank (IR) and lasts as long as casting Time (which the Delay option can extend). The mage then makes the Casting Roll as a 1-turn Incant action on the next IR, called spellfire . For spells with a Free action casting Time, spellstart and spellfire occur on the caster's IR of the same round.

## casting critical results

Critical Failure : a CF means the casting fails and results in Spell Misfire. The caster suffers the 10 fatigue (+5 for every 2 full CL above I) in the Casting Roll table plus any that results from the Spell Misfire Roll.

Critical Success : a CS means the casting succeeds and the duration is tripled for Temporary spells. Individual spell description may specify other results or a different duration increase.

## casting roll example

A mage in a crowded market begins casting Caecity (Lyahvi III, page 232) on a town guard standing within line of sight 30 feet away. The haggling, the clanging of a blacksmith's hammer, and the bustle of the crowd induce a noise penalty of -10. Trying to lessen attention, the mage casts the spell with normal cant but no gesture, bringing the total penalty to -20.

Caecity has a one-round casting Time and the mage has Spell ML81. Spellstart begins on the mage's Initiative Rank of the first round . Concentration is maintained throughout, and then on the IR of the second round , the mage takes a 1-turn action for spellfire. The Casting Roll is against EML61 (Spell ML81 - 20 penalty) and the roll is 68-Failure (F). The mage accrues 10 fatigue: 5 from Failure; plus 5 from the spell's CL III. Since the mage cast without gesturing, and the market's noises likely masked the cant, the GM decides the spellcasting failure goes unnoticed.

The mage decides to try again, beginning spellstart on the third round . The fatigue accrued from the last attempt reduces the same EML61 by 10 more, so the mage decides to employ gesture this time to offset it. After the one round in concentration, the mage takes the 1-turn Incant action for spellfire on the fourth round . Against EML61, the Casting Roll is 49-Success (S). The spell takes effect and the caster accrues 10 more fatigue, for a total of 20.

Caecity's description states that the target now makes a Spirit test. The guard has Spirit ML27, and a roll of 43 means Failure (F), so the guard is blinded for eight rounds.

## [3] Casting Roll

Given the intricacies of Form creation and the vagaries of Principle channelling, each spellcasting does not always produce the same result.

## [�.�] spellfire

If concentration has been kept from spellstart throughout casting Time, the mage then takes a 1-turn Incant action to make a Casting Roll to determine the spell's success and effect. If concentration is spoiled even at spellfire, the caster must Abort (step 1.2).

## [�.�] spell test

To make a Casting Roll, the mage tests Spell EML .

|    | casting roll                                                                                                                                                                    |   fatigue |

Increase	base	fatigue	by	5	for	CL	III-IV	spells;	and	by	10	for	CL	V-VI	spells.

If successful, read the spell's description for its effect. The Spell Format sidebar on page 212 explains in more detail the spell entries.

## [4] Casting Fatigue

A mage relies on personal vigour to cast a spell, represented by the likely gain of fatigue. When this process is maximised (CS), fatigue accrual decreases; when blundered (CF), it increases.

Fatigue accumulated from spellcasting leaves the character briefly winded-see page 176 for the rules on resting and reducing windedness fatigue. Mages often use artefacts created with the Fount spell to absorb fatigue (Neutral III). The Pool spell (Neutral III) and Joined casting option spread the fatigue to other characters.

## [4.�] casting success

The success level of the Casting Roll establishes the base amount of fatigue accrued, as given in the Casting Roll table (0, 5, or 10).

## [4.�] complexity level

Base fatigue reflects casting a Complexity Level I or II spell. Increase fatigue accrual by 5 for CL III-IV spells; and by 10 for CL  V-VI spells.

## [4.3] spell misfire

A Casting Roll CF is called Spell Misfire-see page 203 for its effect. Some Spell Misfire results further increase casting fatigue.

Example : the Casting Roll success level for a CL III spell is a CF-the mage accrues 15 fatigue (5 extra from the CL III) and suffers Spell Misfire. The d100 roll on the Spell Misfire table is 28-Grievous Form Failure. The caster expends 35 more fatigue to prevent the Principle from leaking out of the faulty Form. Among other effects, the total fatigue of 50 reduces the caster's Move 55 to Move 5, barely enabling a staggering walk.

## spell misfire

A CF Casting Roll means the mage unknowingly created a faulty Form and then summoned Principle into it. The result of doing so is unpredictable and often dangerous. Roll d100 roll on the Spell Misfire table. The spell fails and the Misfire effect applies immediately.

## spell misfire

## d100 misfire result

- ≤ 15 minor form failure :	the	spell's	Form	is	inadequate	to	hold	the	Principle. The	caster	must	draw	greatly	on	personal	stamina	to	prevent	principle leak,	accruing	additional	fatigue	equal	to	spell	CL × 5.
- 16-25 serious form failure : same as Minor	Form	Failure,	except	additional fatigue	accrual	equals	spell	CL × 5	plus	10.
- 26-30 grievous form failure : same as Minor	Form	Failure,	except	additional fatigue	accrual	equals	spell	CL × 5	plus	20.
- 31-50 distortion :	the	summoned	Principle	infuses	the	caster's	Aura	with warped	forces,	inflicting	Psyche	Stress 1 .	All	failed	Aura-based	tests	are now	a	CF	when	the	units	die	is	a	3,	5,	8,	or	0.	This	warpage	is	expunged when	the	caster	completes	Psyche	Recovery	(page	189).

- 61-80 minor principle leak :	a	portion	of	the	summoned	Principle	leaks	from	a faulty	Form.	The	caster	prevents	a	Total	Release	only	by	absorbing	it-but suffers	Aural	Shock 1 in	the	process.
- 81-90 serious principle leak :	same	as	61-80,	except	Aural	Shock 3 .
- 91-99 grievous principle leak :	same	as	61-80,	except Aural	Shock 5 .
- 100 + total release :	the	summoned	Principle	escapes	the	Form	uncontained	by the	caster.	Raw	Principle	is	released	into	the	world	(page	204).	The	caster suffers	Psyche	Stress 3 and	must	test	Spirit	ML	(see	sidebar	table).

Crucial Misfire :	a	Spell	Misfire	roll	ending	in	5	or	0	is	called	Crucial	Misfire.	In addition	to	suffering	the	effect	of	the	Spell	Misfire	roll,	the	mage	has	lost	the	ability to	cast	the	spell	that	caused	the	misfire.	While	they	can	still	cast	other	spells,	such mages must at some point reference their grimoire and enter Spell Research to regain	mastery	of	the	lost	spell	(page	205).	After	a	completed	Spell	Research	Roll, halve	the	resulting	time	expended-the	mage	has	then	remastered	the	spell.

Several Spell Misfire entries refer to two other side-effects: Aural Shock and Raw Principle.

## aural shock

Aural Shock disrupts the connection beings in the physical world have with their souls in the spirit world. A mage suffering from it may not cast spells. Its full effect-and how to recover from it-is explained in the Mental Trauma section (page 190).

## raw principle

Raw Principle is pure ethereal energy released into the physical world. Whereas a properly cast spell is fuelled by the mage's controlled channelling of these forces, raw principle is energy that has slipped such boundaries and is quite unpredictable and dangerous. See the following page for its effects.

## total release

A mage who suffers a Total Release accrues Psyche Stress 3, as well as the immediate effects of a Spirit test (-5 penalty per spell CL) on the following table:

## spirit test

- cf transformation :	the	engulfing	Raw Principle	proves	fatal	to	the	caster's body,	turning	it	into	pure	elemental	form appropriate	to	the	Convocation,	such	as	a puff	of	smoke	(Peleahn)	or	watery	puddle (Odivshe).	The	caster	becomes	a	Shade,	a lost	soul	in	the	Spirit	World	(page	396).
- f aural shock 6 and	loss	of	6d6	Spirit	ML.
- s aural shock 4 and	loss	of	4d6	Spirit	ML.
- cs aural shock 2 and	loss	of	2d6	Spirit	ML.

## spell misfire example

Five minutes after successfully casting Caecity on the now blinded town guard (page 202 sidebar), the mage wishes to extend its duration through the Maintain casting option (page 200). He concentrates for half the usual casting Time of 1 round, which is reduced to a free action. On the same IR, the mage takes a one turn action for spellfire against EML51 (10 noise and 20 fatigue penalties).

A 95 is rolled (CF) for 15 fatigue and Spell Misfire (10 fatigue from CF and 5 fatigue from Caecity's CL III). The player rolls 27 for the misfireGrievous Form Failure . In order to prevent the Principle leak, the mage must expend 35 more fatigue (CL × 5 plus 20)-for a total 70 windedness fatigue! While still conscious, the mage doubles over, effectively incapacitated from a Move 55 reduced to 0.

## spell recognition

A Pvaric mage who witnesses another Pvaric mage casting a spell using cant or gesture recognises the action for what it is-Pvaric spellcasting. This requires proper line of sight and listening conditions, so it might call for an Awareness test. Otherwise, such recognition is automatic and requires no action.

Spellcasting recognition is not possible if neither cant nor gesture is perceived in the target mage. This can be the result of the caster not using them or the perceiving mage failing to witness them. Since cant and gesture are so unique to individual Pvarists, spell details , such as convocation, complexity level, and effects, are never revealed in this way-simply the fact that the process is Pvaric magic.

In combat, a mage can employ spellcasting recognition on any Initiative Rank. It most likely comes into play with regard to the Neutral spells Counter, Distort, and Reverse.

Raw	Principle	released	into	the	physical	world	manifests	as	powerful	elemental	energy.	The	effects	vary	according	to	the	spell's	Convocation	or whether	it	was	a	Neutral	spell.	Below	are	some	examples-the	GM	may	devise	others	based	upon	related	elemental	principles.

## odívshè entropic wave

A	shadow	flashes	outward	from	the	caster	60	feet	in	all	directions and	then	disappears.	The	caster	and	any	creature	within	the	entropic wave's	area	at	the	moment	it	passes	must,	at	the	start	of	their	next turn,	make	a	Spirit	test	with	a	penalty	equal	to	the	causal	spell's Complexity	Level ×5:

## spirit - complexity level×5 test

- cf Creature	Passes	and	may	not	move	or	take	free	actions.	Attacks	are Ignored	(retest	same	Spirit	EML	next	turn).
- f Creatures	Passes	and	may	not	move	(retest same Spirit EML next turn).
- s The	creature	must	Pass	this	turn.	The	Entropic	Wave	effect	is	then	over.
- cs The	Entropic	Wave	has	no	effect.

## sàvôrya cloud of madness

The	caster	and	all	nearby	creatures accrue	Psyche	Stress	equal	to the	Complexity	Level	of	the	causal	spell,	minus	one	per	10	full	feet between	them	and	the	caster	(regardless	of	LOS).	Each	victim	tests Will	to	modify	the	PSY	level	amount	further :

| cf : +� psy   | f : +1 psy   | s : +�psy   | cs : -1 psy   |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|

If	the	PSY	level	is	reduced	to	0	or	less,	the	victim	suffers	no	stress.

## lyáhvi tempest

Strong	winds	expand	from	the	caster	in	all	directions	out	to	60	feet. The	tempest	lasts	one	round	per	Complexity	Level	of	the	causal	spell, but	it	does	not	greatly	affect	structures	and	trees.	Creatures	must make	an	opposed	Press	Roll	(d6 + STR)	against	the	tempest,	which rolls	d6 + 10 + (CL × 3).	Each	round,	roll	once	for	the	wind	and	compare its	result	to	each	creature's	own	new	roll	each	turn.

- If the Tempest wins,	the	creature	is	blown	away	from	the	caster	a number	of	feet	equal	to	the	opposed	Press	Roll	margin.	The	caster is	blown	in	a	random	direction.	The	creature	also	suffers	the	usual effects	of	the Press Effect table	(page	106),	perhaps	falling	down.
- If the Tempest loses	or	ties,	the	creature's	maximum	move	into	the direction	of	the	wind	is	limited	according	to	the	margin	of	victory	in the	Press	Roll	(caster	movement	is	affected	in	all	directions):

| margin   | maximummoveintothewind   |

A	number	of	SD	destroys	a	10' × 10'	section	of buildings	according	to	construction:	non-stone	(1	SD),	half-stone	(2 SD),	stone	(3	SD),	fortification	(+1	SD	to	that	from	construction).	Start the	SD-count	at	the	caster,	and	work	outwards.

The	caster	and	all	creatures	within	the	affected	area	also	make an	immediate	opposed	Press	Roll	against	the	quake's	roll	of d6 + 10 + (CL × 5).	Resolve	each	creature's	own	result	against	the	same roll	of	the	quake's	on	the Press Effect table	(page	106).

If	the	Raw	Principle	was	released	entirely	over	water	at	least	10 feet	deep,	then	there	is	no	earthquake.

## jmôrvi noxious cloud

A metallic particle-cloud of toxins erupts around the caster in a 20-foot	radius.	The	cloud	remains	still	for	one	round	and	then	moves with the wind at a rate per round according to Windforce (WF):

|   wf | rate           |
|------|----------------|
|    0 | 20' per round  |
|    1 | 60' per round  |
|    2 | 120' per round |
|    3 | 180' per round |
|    4 | 240' per round |

The moving cloud remains intact for a number of rounds equal to the	Complexity	Level	of	the	causal	spell.	Creatures	the	cloud	touches make	an	immediate	Shock	Roll	against	SHK 8	(page	169,	step	4.3).

## pèleáhn hyper burst

A	volatile	magical	force	bursts	around	the	caster	in	a	15-foot	radius. It	lasts	for	a	number	of	rounds	equal	to	the	causal	spell's	Complexity Level.	The	caster	and	creatures	within	it	on	their	turn	receive	an additional	action	option,	taken	on	their	IR	after	their	regular	action.

- The	Incant	action	may	only	be	chosen	once	per	turn.
- As	soon	as	the	second	action	is	completed	(even	if	a	Pass),	the creature	makes	an Endurance test:

## endurance test

- cf The	creature	accrues	20	weariness	fatigue.
- f The	creature	accrues	10	weariness	fatigue.
- s The	creature	accrues	5	weariness	fatigue.
- cs No	effect.

Movement perpendicular to the wind is limited to the same rates above unless the creature succeeds on a Stumble Roll (falling on a failure).	Movement	away	from	the	wind	is	unaffected.

If	fatigue	equals	or	exceeds	Move,	the	character	still	accrues	fatigue and	makes	the	END	test	but	does	not	receive	the	additional	action.

## neutral chaos storm

An	interdimensional	storm	of	pure	chaotic	force	materialises	around	the	caster.	Treat	it	just	like the	Neutral	VI	spell	Vortex	(page	255)	with	a	Spell	Index	(SI)	equal	to	the	Complexity	Level	of the	causal	spell.	Thus,	a	CL	IV	spell	creates	an	SI4	Vortex	that	has	a	5-foot	diameter,	an	80-foot diameter	roaming	range	around	it,	and	lasts	4	rounds.	Note	that	mages	who	cast	the	spell	do not have	the	option	to	shield	their	sources	of	Arcane	energy	from	the	Vortex,	but	do	risk	gaining weariness	fatigue	and	Psyche	Stress	Levels	from	its	dispelling	effect	(see	spell	description).

## spell research

Mages make a profound, time-consuming commitment to learn or invent new spells. Such spell research involves reading old tomes, seeking advice from colleagues, and making nascent castings. Once the research successfully ends, the spell is known and the mage may cast it.

## spell research capability

To learn spells, either Pvarists require the help of chantry mentors and libraries ( assisted research ); or, at higher levels of knowledge, they can learn-or invent-spells on their own ( unassisted research ). The Spell Research Capability table in the sidebar shows by Convocation Affinity the minimum Pvarism ML needed to begin such research.

Example 1 : a Shek-Pvar mage with Pvarism ML24 may only enter assisted spell research to learn Primary convocation spells.

Example 2 : a Shek-Pvar mage with Pvarism ML80 may undertake assisted research to learn Tertiary and Neutral convocation spells, and unassisted research to learn or invent Primary and Secondary spells.

Example 3 : a character is not a Shek-Pvar member but has a mentor and has Natural Attunement arcane talent with the highest sunsign modifier in Nature. This 'sorcerer' has Pvarism ML 42 and can do assisted research with the mentor to learn Neutral spells, or do unassisted research to learn or invent Fyvria spells.

## Spell Research Routine

To undertake spell research, mages select a spell within a convocation which they are capable of researching-either assisted or unassistedand then following these five steps.

[�] Difficulty : note the Spell Difficulty (DIF), equal to the sum of Complexity Level (CL) and Convocation Degree (CD). This is the same formula used for spellcasting, as noted in the page 200 sidebar:

spell difficulty  =  complexity level  +  convocation degree

Natural Attunement : a character with the Natural Attunement talent halves the spell DIF when undertaking research in the associated Primary convocation (retain fractions).

[�] Resources Modifier : a mage must have access to a chantry's libraries and mentors to undertake assisted research. The spell may be of any convocation, and the chantry may be of any quality and convocation. However, the chantry's star rating determines the convocations for which it is best capable of providing such assistance, as described in the Chantry Resources sidebar section and table.

Increase the research Difficulty (DIF) by one for each star quality the chantry providing the assistance falls short of the optimal Resources, as rated by the chantry's star quality and associated Primary convocation (the mage's own Primary convocation is immaterial to this calculation).

Proxy Resource : a private library or special adviser might be able to serve as a proxy 'chantry', but they usually provide only one-star Resources. The GM designates the proxy's Primary convocation.

Unassisted Research : mages simply need their own grimoire and a safe and quiet location to concentrate. While a chantry is not needed for unassisted research, being at one grants a bonus in step 4.

## spell research capability

|   ml | assisted            | unassisted                               |
|------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
|   10 | None                | NoneorPrimary 1                          |
|   20 | Primary             | NoneorPrimary 1                          |
|   40 | Primary • Neutral   | NoneorPrimary 1                          |
|   70 | Secondary • Neutral | Primary                                  |
|   80 | Tertiary • Neutral  | Primary • Secondary                      |
|   90 | Diametric • Neutral | Primary • Secondary Tertiary             |
|  100 | Neutral             | Primary • Secondary Tertiary • Diametric |

1 Characters	with	Natural	Attunement	(page	262)	may begin Unassisted Research to learn and invent spells in	the	associated	Primary	convocation	at	ML10;	and Assisted Research to learn Neutral	spells	at	ML40.

Shèk-Pvâr Rank : Young Shek-Pvar usually start with Pvarism ML between 40 and 69. Those with exceptional talent (SB18) or a remarkable legacy (Shek-Pvar parents) might start with a higher ML, but are usually still limited in research to the Primary and Neutral convocations. The GM could instead deem these characters 'prodigies' and, indeed, allow research according to their literal ML. Such characters might also have completed the customary year's length of adventuring (page 199), and be on their way to Shenava status.

## chantry resources

A Pvaric chantry's star quality dictates how well it supports assisted spell research according to its own associated Primary convocation.

| quality   | optimal resources       |
|-----------|-------------------------|
|          | Primary                 |
|         | As above plus Neutral   |
|        | As above plus Secondary |
|       | As above plus Tertiary  |
|      | As above plus Diametric |

Example : a mage does assisted research on a Peleahn spell at the two-star Odivshe Jarehm chantry in Ivinia. Such a Diametric spell is best supported at a five-star chantry, so the DIF increases by three (5 stars - 2 stars = 3), as explained in step 2.

## grimoires

Shek-Pvar mages write their own personal spell repositories called grimoires. At character generation, PC Shek-Pvar freely receive a grimoire that has 128 pages and weighs 3 lb, per 16 known spells. Expansion requires 15d and 8 pages per spell (+1 lb per 5 spells), acquired at generation through Wealth, or later with coin. Wise Shek-Pvar make entire duplicates, as well.

## spell research example

At a Savorya 3-star chantry, a Savorya mage with Pvarism ML84 and CRE 13 wishes to learn the spell Animus (Fyvria V). As the Spell Research Capability table shows (page 205 sidebar), this requires assisted research for a Savoryan with Pvarism ML80-89, since Fyvria is a Tertiary convocation.

The spell has DIF 8 (CL5 + CD3) plus 1 from chantry resources-the Savorya three-star chantry is one below the optimal four stars for learning a Tertiary spell. The final base research time is 75 days (30 + [DIF 9 × 5]). The mage has Fyvria Convocation ML79 and Creativity Index  6. The Research Roll is 32 and the SR is 4. This produces SV8 and a fourstar result, reducing the research time to 55 days. The mage now knows Animus at ML63 (Fyvria Convocation ML79 minus twice DIF 8; the Difficulty increase for chantry quality applies only to research).

## spell invention

Mages often resort to spell invention to bring about a specific artefact enchantment effect that does not already exist, or to tweak existing or create new spells. Whatever the reason for spell invention, keep in mind that the reality of Kethira imposes certain esoteric limits:

-  Some magical effects have not been discovered or harnessed yet, such as pure flying and electricity.
-  Long-distance observation spells require the caster to have perceived the target's True Form beforehand (page 209 sidebar).
-  Mind control effects include a Psychic Bond between caster and target (page 237).
-  Only Grey mages are able to invent Neutral spells (page 210).
-  Casting Times vary by Convocation and Spell Complexity according to a standard pattern:

| convocation      | i    | ii   | iii   | iv   | v    | vi   |
|------------------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|
| Pèleáhn          | Free | Free | 1-rd  | 1-rd | 2-rd | 2-rd |
| Jmôrvi • Lyahvi  | Free | 1-rd | 1-rd  | 2-rd | 2-rd | 3-rd |
| Fývria • Sàvôrya | 1-rd | 1-rd | 2-rd  | 2-rd | 3-rd | 3-rd |
| Odívshè          | 1-rd | 2-rd | 2-rd  | 3-rd | 3-rd | 4-rd |

Ultimately, spell invention is game-art, not game-science. Players should know well the over 200 spells already provided and balance new effects to the established ones. While they have a listed maximum Complexity Level of VI, there is likely no theoretical limit. It is thought that Grey Mages over the centuries, either alone or more likely in consort, have at least attempted research into more powerful magic.

[�] Base Research Time : after establishing spell Difficulty, the arcanist undertakes research for a base time of 20 + 3d6 days + 5 days per DIF.

## base research time in days  =  20 + 3d6 + dif × 5

The mage spends 10 hours per day in concentrated study. Even the offhours are spent in quiet contemplation, and restful sleep is integral to the esoteric process. The research must essentially be continuous, but a day's break every d6 + 5 days will not spoil it.

[�] Spell Research Roll : the mage then makes a Convocation (Creativity SR) Success Value test. The Convocation tested is the one to which the researched spell belongs. Weakness fatigue applies if it lasts throughout at least half the base research time. Grievous skull injury, or being incapacitated or unconscious at any point, ruins the research.

Unassisted Bonus : a mage doing unassisted research at a chantry has a +�� bonus to the test if the chantry's Resources include the Convocation of the researched spell. For example, doing unassisted research in the chantry's Secondary convocation at a �-star or better chantry gives the bonus; but not at �- and �-star chantries (see page 205 sidebar table).

Creativity SR : with a Convocation S or CS, increase SV by � if the Creativity SR succeeds.

## sv convocation ml (creativity sr) success value test

[�] Spell Research Completion : a mage who completes the research, and avoids the harm of CF, has created the spell's Form; Principle may now be summoned to fill it. The mage knows the spell, and the research has added it to a grimoire. Spell ML is determined (page 200 sidebar).

## convocation channelling

Pvarism maintains that the six principle energies express themselves in the minds and bodies of all folk: growth and decay (Fyvria); foundational minerals (Jmorvi); movement and necessary warmth (Peleahn); crucial breath of air (Lyahvi); thought and emotion (Savorya); life-sustaining water (Odivshe). Living creatures are therefore Pvarically Neutral entities, as they exhibit these six elements to varying degrees all at once.

However, it was discovered that at the outset of training a mage most easily learns by concentrating on just one of the six energies. This requisite focus culminates as convocational Primary attunement. While the other five elements do not disappear to the mage, they become simply harder to access at the same time that the attuned element becomes easier to access.

In addition to affecting Pvarism ML, convocational attunement allows for convocation channelling. Because of the broad training in their Primary convocation, Shek-Pvar may perform two special tasks with this ability-spontaneous casting and spontaneous research.

## Spontaneous Casting

A moderate level of training in an attuned convocation gives the mage the ability to create simple spell-like effects very quickly. Upon attaining Pvarism ML  60 , the Shek-Pvar may perform such spontaneous casting in their Primary convocation. A Grey mage may attempt Spontaneous Casting in all six convocations (but not Neutral).

As the Form created is not intricate and idiosyncratic, spontaneous casting is not complicated. The mage creates a general Form to hold a slight amount of Principle-just enough to produce a subtle effect.

The mage follows these four steps to cast spontaneously.

[�] Effect : describe an effect that impacts the caster or emanates no more than Convocational Index feet from the mage's body. The effect may express only the element or associated principles of the mage's Primary convocation. For examples, see the sidebar Convocation Effects tables on the first page of each convocation's spell entry section (starting on page 213).

[�] Time : Spontaneous Casting takes one turn . The time in seconds varies slightly according to the mage's primary convocation and even with each casting. For a precise time, roll the given die in the sidebar.

[�] Test : make a roll against Convocation ML (include any bonus from an Elemental Focus). Unlike with spellcasting, Spontaneous Casting has no cant and gesture requirement and induces no fatigue loss -although fatigue and impairment penalties apply to the test itself, as for a Casting Roll (page 201).

## spontaneous casting roll

- cf The	casting	fails;	the	mage	suffers	Aural	Shock	1	(no	further	Spell	Mishap).
- f The	casting	fails	but	may	be	repeated.
- s The	casting	succeeds.
- cs The	casting	succeeds;	double	the	brief	Duration	if	desired.

[�] Duration : the minor effect lasts one round . For an exact, variable duration, roll two of the Time dice shown in the sidebar.

## spontaneous spell times

Spontaneous casting is a 1-turn action, and the effect lasts one round. For added detail to the game narrative, consider rolling the following dice according to convocation to determine the precise casting time. Roll two of the same dice for spell duration:

| convocation   | time   | convocation   | time   |
|---------------|--------|---------------|--------|
| Odívshè       | d5 sec | Fývria        | d4 sec |
| Sàvôrya       | d4 sec | Jmôrvi        | d3 sec |
| Lyáhvi        | d3 sec | Pèleáhn       | d2 sec |

Spontaneous Casting Example : facing a henchman suspected of treachery, an Odivshe mage wishes to coerce her into confessing. As part of the Intimidation skill test, the mage's player includes an Odivshe Convocational effect where ethereal darkness briefly lines the caster's face in shadows, giving the mage a menacing look. With no required cant or gesture, such Spontaneous Casting takes place without the henchman knowing what is taking place. The Spontaneous Casting Roll is a Success (S) and the GM rolls 2d5 to see how long the shadows last-6 seconds. The GM decides that the casting grants +5 bonus to the Intimidation test, leaving the henchman especially unsettled by the mage's demeanour, regardless of the coercion's ultimate effectiveness.

## spontaneous research

Starting at Pvarism ML 100 , Shek-Pvar may do spontaneous research in their Primary convocation. A Grey mage may do so in all six convocations (but not Neutral). Such channelling combines spur-of-the-moment 'research' and spellcasting into a single roll.

[�] Spell : the mage selects or invents an unknown spell in the Primary convocation.

[�] Time : double the usual casting time of the spell according to its entry (a Free Action time increases to one round).

[�] Test : the mage casts the spell as if it were known but with an additional -60 penalty. Refer to the Spellcasting section and apply all the usual modifiers. Resolve the test using the Casting Roll table (page 202) but include the following results:

## spontaneous research roll

- cf Spell	Misfire	with	+20	to	its	d100	roll.
- f Spell	Misfire	with	-40	to	its	d100	roll.
- s Spell	takes	the	S	effect	as	described.
- cs Spell	takes	the	CS		effect	as	described.

[�] Result : With success, the spell takes effect. The mage also earns 5 days (CS 10) towards actually learning the spell through Spell Research (page 205).

## arcane attunement

In order to invoke or benefit from some arcane artefact enchantments, beings must first establish a connection between their soul and the item. Such attunement is often required with minor artefacts (page 256) and always is with major artefacts (page 257) and engraved objects (page 284).

## Attunement Methods

There are several ways to attune to an arcane artefact:

## bonded attunement

Arcanists automatically have bonded attunement with the artefacts they create. Characters with the Natural Attunement arcane talent also become bonded upon touching an artefact that has the same object element as their associated elemental principle.

Bonded attunement is instantaneous and permanent. Characters must still be in contact with bonded artefacts in order to invoke or benefit from their effects, but nothing breaks it, except the artefact's destruction.

## attune spell

A mage who successfully casts Attune (page 250) gains Indefinite attunement with the artefact. It can be lost in three ways: the mage cancels the Attune spell; someone else specifically targets and dispels the mage's Attune spell; or the mage suffers contact loss with the artefact (below).

## sensitivity talent

A character who successfully invokes Sensitivity (page 263) gains Indefinite attunement with the artefact. Cancellation, dispelling, and contact loss can break it.

## proximate attunement

A character who maintains contact with an artefact for one day may test Spirit to establish attunement. Once the character succeeds, only contact loss can break it.

Volition Resistance : subtract from the Spirit test EML a major artefact's Ego or Will secondary modifier.

Example : a character with Spirit ML45 attempts proximate attunement with a major artefact that has Ego 7. After maintaining contact for one day, the test is made against EML55 (45 minus the artefact's -10 Ego secondary modifier). The artefact's low Ego makes attunement easier.

## proximate attunement

## spirit - volition secondary modifier  test

- cf unattuned :	retry	allowed	in	d6 + 1	days.	Major	artefacts	with a	Morality	might	induce	Antipathetic	Reaction	(see	below).
- f unattuned :	retry	allowed	the	next	day.
- s attuned :	Indefinite	attunement	achieved.
- cs attuned :	as	above,	plus	character	receives	+20	bonus	to resist	Contact	Loss	with	the	attuned	artefact	(see	below).

## Antipathetic Reaction

An Antipathetic Reaction occurs when attuners make a CF Proximate Attunement Roll with a major artefact whose Morality score is at least 6 points different from their own. If so, roll d100 on the following table to determine the effect of the attuner's adverse reaction:

## antipathetic   reaction

| d100   | effect          | d100   | effect                 |
|--------|-----------------|--------|------------------------|
| 01-15  | Psyche Stress 1 | 71-75  | Amnesia                |
| 16-30  | Psyche Stress 2 | 76-80  | Blindness              |
| 31-40  | Psyche Stress 3 | 81-85  | Deafness               |
| 41-55  | Aural Shock 1   | 86-90  | Muteness               |
| 56-65  | Aural Shock 2   | 91-95  | Paralysis              |
| 66-70  | Aural Shock 3   | 96-00  | Roll twoeffects (only) |

Effects : refer to Psyche Stress (page 188) and Aural Shock (page 190). For other effects, see their descriptions on page 184, and test HB × HR5 every d6 days on the Disease Course Roll table to resolve (page 184). If HR is reduced to 0, the effect remains as an Indefinite arcane 'curse' that only Dispel (Neutral II) can remove (-40 penalty). If HR rises to 6, the character recovers.

Shock : in addition to the above effects, Antipathetic Reaction forces the attuner to make a Shock Roll against SHK 6 (SHK 7 if the initial d100 Antipathetic Reaction roll ended in a 0 or 5). An attuner suffering from two effects applies a -20 penalty to the Shock Roll. Resolve using the Injury Sequence, starting with step 4.3 (page 169).

## Contact Loss

After establishing Indefinite attunement, characters retain it by remaining in contact with the artefact. This is satisfied by holding or wearing it close. Aura exudes about one foot beyond a person's body, so keeping the object even this near is sufficient to remain attuned.

However, losing such contact with the artefact for one full day risks the loss of attunement. The literal distance is immaterial-being two feet or two miles away both constitute contact loss. The attuned person tests Spirit .

Enhanced Connection : characters who achieved a CS on their Proximate Attunement Roll with the artefact receive a +�� bonus to Contact Loss Spirit tests.

## contact loss

## spirit test

- cf attunement broken :	character	has	a	-20	penalty	to reestablish attunement with the artefact.
- f attunement broken :	character	may	try	to	reestablish	it.
- s attunement maintained despite contact loss; retest if contact	not	regained	within	a	day.
- cs attunement maintained for	d6	days	despite	contact	loss; then	retest	if	contact	not	regained	within	the	ensuing	day.

## Forced Attunement

A major artefact with purpose whose Volition exceeds the Will of someone touching it may immediately attempt forced attunement, and may continue to do so if the person resists but remains in contact with it. The artefact makes a test of Ego or Spirit minus the person's Will modifier. Resolve on the Proximate Attunement table (page 208).

Example : a character with WIL12 and MOR13 picks up the Reaver of Ilpylen, a major artefact sword with EGO15 and MOR6. With an Ego greater than the character's Will, the artefact makes a Forced Attunement test against Ego EML70 (ML75 minus the character's +5 Will bonus). A roll of 80 critically fails (CF). The character makes a d100 Antipathetic Reaction roll because the sword's Morality is seven points lower. A 05 roll means the character suffers one level of Psyche Stress and makes a Shock Roll against SHK7. If the character does not let go of the sword, another Forced Attunement roll is made d6 + 1 days later.

## Artefact Domination

A character attuned to a major artefact with a purpose receives the same purpose, as an Indefinite psyche trait. Some purposes have a one-word description; others might be more complicated. If the character loses attunement with the artefact, then the purpose trait is lost.

As with any trait, the player chooses when the purpose motivates or affects the character. If the character acts or withholds action in clear opposition to the purpose, the GM may call for an Artefact Domination roll. This is an opposed test of the artefact's Ego or Spirit against the attuned character's Spirit :

## artefact domination

## opposed ego/spirit (artefact) vs spirit test (character)

- The	character	resists	the	domination	attempt.	The	character's	actions	are	free from	eliciting	opposed	Artefact	Domination	tests	for	one	day	per	star	victory.
- t Break	all	ties-even	failures;	the	winner	gets	a	one-star	victory.
- For	each	artefact	star	victory,	the	character	suffers	one	Psyche	Stress	Level. During	Psyche	Stress	Recovery	(page	189),	the	associated	purpose	becomes an	indefinite	Psyche	Impulse	and	the	character's	Morality	score	is	averaged with	the	artefact's	Morality	score.

If the Impulse becomes permanent during stress recovery, the averaged Morality score does, too. If the Impulse remains indefinite and the character eventually recovers from it, then Morality returns to normal.

## consonance

Aura extends a foot beyond a creature's body. This 'zone' of Aura creates an esoteric bond with objects worn or carried within it that weigh in total no more than half the creature's Spirit ML. Such Aura-object consonance determines how much clothing/gear accompany them during dematerialisation of gateway transferral and certain spells. To meet the limit, objects are ignored in order of heaviest weight, whether carried in hand, slung as gear, or worn as an article (select randomly with ties).

As an estimation, a suit of armour weighs ten plus double its ENC rating in pounds (page 112); clothing weighs 5 lb; heavy clothing, 10 lb. The Armour Suits (pages 113-116) provide these estimated amounts. See also Advice &amp; Options on page 348 for more Consonance options.

## true form

Living entities-such as natural spirits, elementals, people, and creatures-all have a soul, also called their True Form . The concept of True Form shapes the scope of certain arcane and astral mysteries. Kethiran arcanists cannot wield powers such as clairvoyance and telepathy as easily as perhaps those on other worlds can, especially against targets many miles away. To do so on Kethira requires them first to have perceived the target's True Form.

In the spirit world, entities can perceive another's True Form with a Spirit Sensing test (page 295). In the physical world, it can be read esoterically in the target entity's Aura. Listed below are the abilities that require perception of a target's True Form, reveal a True Form, or conceal it from detection.

## require

These spells and talents require incanters to have perceived beforehand the target's True Form. Successfully perceiving a target's True Form is permanent. Characters do not need to repeat the process after the first time-True Forms are 'stored' in their esoteric memory.

Spells : Fervour (S-II, Bonus Effect 9); Enquiry (S-I); Mask (N-V, Duplicated); Wasting (F-IV, Bonus Effect  9); Whisper (L-I, Bonus Effect  9); Wisdom (S-III).

Talents : Clairvoyance (Being); Hex (Far), Prescience (Vision); Psychometry (Being); Telepathy (Far).

## reveal

These esoteric skill tasks and incantations allow esotericists to perceive a target's True Form. This ability is called True Sight .

Skill tasks : Sunsign Perception, Astromancy, Runecasting, Tarot Reading.

Spirit world action : Sensing.

Spells : Unveiling (L-III); Insight (S-II).

Talents : Clairvoyance, Enthral, Hex, Psychometry, Prescience, Telepathy, Visnomy.

## conceal

The following esoterica conceal a being's True Form. This blocks True Sight and makes it impossible for the concealed being even to register as a target of incantations that require True Form.

Effects : Aural Shock and Dissolution.

Elixir : Soulcloak.

Spell : Enigma (O-VI). This spell has the side effect of making its concealed target unable to express Aura-thus inducing a sort of 'Aural Shock' throughout duration (see page 245).

## grey magic

The most talented and dedicated Shek-Pvar may eventually attempt to surpass the limitations of convocational casting by unifying the hexagonal Pvarist philosophy into a single practice called Grey magic. A grey mage is able to manipulate all principles with equal ability.

## Prerequisites

In order to become a grey mage, the Shek-Pvar incanter must satisfy four requirements.

Vîrán : attain the status of master.

Mastery : attain at least Pvarism ML100.

Spells : know spells that have the following minimum total Difficulty by Convocation: Primary (30 DIF), Neutral (20 DIF), both Secondary (10 DIF each), both Tertiary (10 DIF each), Diametric (10 DIF).

Grey Transformation : complete the Ritual of the Core and then succeed in the subsequent Metamorphosis Roll.

## ritual of the core

Once the other three prerequisites are met, the would-be Grey must then perform the lengthy Ritual of the Core. This is done as if it were assisted Neutral Spell Research with a Difficulty of 10 minus the star quality of the mage's home chantry.

Upon completing the Ritual, the mage immediately makes a Metamorphosis Roll . This is a Pvarism test with a penalty equal to 30 minus the sunsign modifier of the Primary convocation. This means the total penalty will range between -15 and -45. A negative sunsign modifier actually makes the metamorphosis easier since the mage has greater balance with the more difficult convocations.

## metamorphosis roll

## pvarism - 30 - primary sunsign modifier

- cf The attempt fails; mage suffers Spell Misfire (page 203) and Aural	Shock	6,	cumulative	with	any	suffered	from	misfire.	The Ritual	of	the	Core	may	never	be	attempted	again.
- f The	attempt	fails;	mage	suffers	Aural	Shock 4 .	Once	recovered from	Aural	Shock,	mage	may	repeat	Ritual	of	the	Core	and Metamorphosis Roll (-10	penalty	per	previous		failure).
- s The	attempt	succeeds;	mage	suffers	Aural	Shock � .
- cs The	attempt	succeeds.

Example : a Savoryan mage with Pvarism ML101 has satisfied the first three grey mage prerequisites and has just completed the Ritual of the Core research. All that remains is the Metamorphosis Roll. With a Hirin sunsign, a Savoryan mage has a +5 Primary convocation modifier. This gives a 35 penalty (negative 30 minus +5) to the Pvarism ML101 test, for a final Metamorphosis Roll EML 66.

## Grey Benefits

Upon successfully making the Metamorphosis Roll and overcoming any accompanying Aural Shock, the Shek-Pvar becomes a Grey mage. They usually keep only nominal ties with their original chantry and often join or form new organisations, such as the White College in Emelrene.

The following rules apply to Grey mages.

Neutral Attunement : Grey mages no longer have attunement with just a single Primary convocation, and they lose the benefits of the Natural Attunement talent, if they had it. A Grey mage has overcome the limitations of just singular convocational attunement and has attained the broader perspective of Neutral attunement. For casting and research purposes, all spells-even ones previously learned-are now considered Neutral.

Spell MLs are refigured based upon Neutral ML. Complexity Levels remain unchanged, but all spells have Neutral Affinity and a Complexity Degree of 2 (page 200 sidebar). For mages who had a positive Sunsign modifier in their Primary convocation, Grey casting makes Primary and Secondary spells more difficult, while making Tertiary and Diametric ones concomitantly easier. The opposite is true if the Sunsign modifier was negative.

Spontaneous casting and spontaneous research are allowed in all six non-Neutral convocations, since the Grey mage's Pvarism ML100+ applies to all six convocations.

Neutral Research : Grey mages may undertake unassisted research in Neutral spells.

Neutral Spells : Grey mages may invent Neutral spells. When creating non-Neutral spells, they still categorise them according to Convocation. Thus, while a new fire spell is Neutral to a Grey mage, it belongs to the Peleahn Convocation for non-Grey mages to learn.
