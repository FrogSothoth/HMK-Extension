# Ívashù

## Ívashù

Also known as the Fatherless Multitude or the Accursed Beasts of the Barren Cycle , the Ivashu are strange creatures allegedly created by the god Ilvir at Araka-Kalai on the island of Hârn. Ivashu have no gender and no ability to reproduce, but Ilvir reincarnates their souls in new bodies each time they die. While most common on Hârn, Ivashu are found throughout Lythia and likely all of Kethira.

Six examples are detailed in the following section, but the true variety is uncountable. The Ívashù Generation rules on page 376 help GMs create any sort of Ivashu they can imagine-small or huge; aquatic or land borne; tentacled, horned, pincered, or fanged.

## Ívashù Abilities

Ivashu possess a variety of strange features, including arcane powers, distorted bodies, and bizarre natural weapons. Given their common combative nature, many are captured for arena spectacles, such as the Pamesani Games. Some are intelligent and speak the Ivashi language. Even those who cannot articulate Ivashi seem to understand it intuitively or even telepathically when it is spoken (see Hailing Ivashu, right).

Aberrance : nearly all Ivashu possess Aberrance (page 187). Folk suffer its effect immediately if the Ivashu is patently grotesque or, otherwise, when they witness an overt expression of the creature's strange abilities.

Arcane Talents : many Ivashu possess Arcane Talents, so noted by the letter t next to the power's name in the Ivashu's list of skills. Unless otherwise noted, they are invoked as a 1-turn action using the routine on page 259.

Regeneration : Some Ivashu have the ability to heal injuries at a preternatural rate. An Aklash has such regeneration (page 373). In addition to the explanation in its entry, regeneration includes the following rules.

Shock State : regeneration does not affect the creature's recovery from Shock States.

KIA : regeneration ceases the moment the creature suffers a KIA shock state.

Bleeding : if regeneration heals a bleeding injury to a severity where it no longer meets the requirements to be a bleeder, then the bleeding stops.

Impairment : as regeneration reduces an injury's severity, any accompanying impairment also lessens. Thus, a Grievous injury that makes a zone unusable only imparts 10 impairment when it regenerates to a Serious injury. Upon regenerating to a Minor injury, the zone is unaffected (0 impairment).

## Hailing Ívashù

Ilviran clergy of at least Circle III can use the Ivashi language in a special Ritual Devotion (page 328) to attract and perhaps control nearby Ivashu. The lexicon and syntax of such hailing varies according to clerical order and individual clergy. It can include chanting, singing, shrieking, and other wailing noises-all quite loud. However bizarre, the hailing is mundane, not arcane.

To hail an Ivashu, Ilviran clergy of Circle III or higher with at least one Piety take the following four steps.

[�] Time : the cleric spends 10 minutes articulating the sounds in the chosen fashion. Followers can contribute to the cacophony as assistants with a high enough Ritual ML.

[�] Test : the hailer spends one Piety and makes an Ilvir Ritual (Ivashi Language · Creativity SR) Success Value test (a CRE success increases SV by 1).

[�] Hailing Roll : each star result in step 2 grants a d10 Hailing Roll against a TN determined by how close the nearest Ivashu is (see Ivashu Proximity table). Roll each d10 separately against the same TN. Any number of successes hails at least one Ivashu. The GM selects the type and number-larger ones are usually solitary (so only one arrives no matter the successes); smaller ones arrive as a group (one or d6 per success). The same character's hailing attempt has effect only once per 5-league area per day.

[�] Control Test : how long it takes for the Ivashu to arrive varies according to their mobility and the terrain. Upon meeting them, the hailer makes an opposed test of Ivashi (Command) against the Ivashu's Will test (break successful ties). The hailer gains one minute of control over the Ivashu for each victory star. During this time, the hailer may issue commands as 1-turn actions by speaking Ivashi; the Ivashu then act accordingly on their own Initiative Rank.

A Will victory for the Ivashu means it resists control for one day, reacting with an aggressiveness measured by its victory star margin and own nature.

Unhailed Control : Ivashu met by chance may be controlled by qualified clerics who make the opposed control test in step 4 with -20 penalty.

BESTIARY 7

ÍVASHÙ

## áklash

6'-8' tall · 6��-8�� lbs  large

A voracious and aggressive omnivore, an Aklash has a hairless body covered in rolls of pale fat that rapidly heals from wounds even when it's unconscious. While a large, fanged mouth and sharp talons make it a dangerous foe, most alarmingly an Aklash can also exhale a cloud of nauseating gas. Strangely, its brain resides in the thorax.

Choking Wind : as a free action on its turn, an Aklash can try to belch a cloud of nauseating gas against one foe within 10 feet. The Choking Wind test dictates whether enough is ready to discharge that turn. Failure means the gas lies dormant for the indicated time. If discharged, the cloud engulfs the target and forces it to make a Shock Roll against SHK 7.

Regeneration : at the end of its turn, roll d10 against TN 2. A success reduces the most severe  IL  by  one (see page 372 ).

## dómôrsèr

3' high · 5' long · 175 lbs  medium

Also called Nightcrawlers , Domorsers resemble large, scaly wolves. They have padded feet, retractable claws, powerful jaws of long sharp teeth, and dark highset eyes with excellent nocturnal vision. They hunt in small packs and seem to coordinate attacks without audible calls.

Paralysis : a nightcrawler's venomous fangs can induce paralysis. The Shock Roll of victims injured by its bite also determines whether the venom takes effect (HP 10 minutes · HR6 - IL).

Sensitivity : a successful test lets them know the location of prey within Talent Index × 300 feet (CS includes the prey's awareness statesleeping , conscious ).

Telepathy : a successful test allows projected communication with other Domorsers within 600 feet for 1 minute. Reception is automatic.

Paralysis Example : a Domorser successfully bites Elben, inflicting an M1 p injury to his left forearm. Even with such a slight wound (SHK 2), the character tests Shock to determine whether the Nightcrawler's venom takes effect. Against Shock ML40, the roll is 72-Failure (F), so paralysis will overcome him in d6 minutes (the GM secretly rolls 4 minutes).

Elben survives the battle but four minutes later becomes paralysed, falling prone and unable to move. The paralysis is an ailment with HR5, equal to HR6 minus the M1 of the causal injury. The Healing Period is 10 minutes, when Elben tests his HB12 × HR5 on the Exposure Healing Roll table (page 185). The paralysis ends at HR6.

ívashù

## hrú

1�'-15' tall · 6���-8��� lbs  colossal

During the day a Hru takes shape as an inert pile of rocks or a large boulder. Groups of up to forty lay strewn across high mountain wastes. During the night they usually transform into Rock Giants , immensely bloated humanoid shapes with dry, hardened bodies. They remain peaceful, unless their stony fastness is defiled or threatened.

Rumble : at night Hru converse with each other through strange, rumbling songs. The register is so deep that it causes discomfort in other beings. Non-Hru within a league must test Endurance at the start of each turn or suffer -20 penalty to all actions for one round.

Trample : when moving over a prone target, a Hru may make one kick attack. See Animal Special Abilities (page 354) for the entire Trample description.

Transform : an hour before sunrise, a Hru tests Spirit once every minute. Any success transforms it into a pile of rocks or single boulder (repeat until successful). Duration: until an hour after sunset.

## nólah

6-7' tall · �-3�� lbs  medium

The Dank Stalker inhabits damp caves and ruined dungeons or hides beneath remote shadowy bridges. Able to contort their moist, hairless bodies through slim cracks of rock and earth, Nolahrin stalk prey alone, with silent cunning. An arcane talent allows them to lure far-off victims to their lairs. A Nolah has a ghastly taste for human flesh and will often stack its victim's bones into bizarre cairns.

Contort : Nolahrin may squeeze through cracks at least 3" wide with Move 10.

Yearning Geas : as a one-minute action, a Nolah tests Geas against any creature within half Index miles in an attempt to lure it to its location (not always its lair). The victim opposes with a Spirit test (break ties). Awake targets get +20 bonus.

Overrun Example : a Hru engaged with three human soldiers from five feet away selects the Charge action and makes a Press Attack (page 106) against one of them. The Hru's test succeeds (S), while the soldier's Dodge test fails (F). The Press Rolls  are 54 (Hru) versus 13 (soldier)-the soldier is knocked back ten feet, prone, and makes a SHK 7 Shock Roll. The Overrun rule (page 353) allows the Hru to ignore the two other soldiers' EZ and take the 15 feet of its Charge half Move now, on

Yearning Geas Example : a Nolah targets a sleeping Galmos two miles away. The Geas test roll is 33 (Success); Galmost fails his Spirit test (F), so rises and sets off for the Nolah's cave, awake but confused about the need for the sudden midnight hike. See the page 187 sidebar for the outcome.

## umbáth

�' tall incarnation  tiny

Otherwise known as Bearers of the Mask or Gargoyles , the Umbathri are found in all parts of Kethira-above or below ground, in cities or the wilderness. They appear as grey, squat, and exceedingly ugly humanoid figures with yellow eyes, a ghastly red tongue, and a tail. They act both alone and in insanely babbling packs of up to two dozen. Their behaviour is capricious and often maddening.

Incarnation : an Umbath's body is like the form of an incarnated spirit (page 393). However, while it has a definite shape, observers must successfully test Awareness to see it in dim lighting (CS to see it in deep shadows).

An Umbath tests dodge to avoid melee attacks and has three zone numbers in its Body Location table. Only enchanted weapons or spells have effect. If struck, it must successfully test Spirit to avoid dissolution and loss of form for d6 days (CF 3d6 days). After this period, it automatically reassumes form.

Umbathri fly away when they cease harassing their targets (see Torment).

With mud-brown scales, powerful hind legs and tail, stunted forepaws, and a protruding snout of jagged teeth, Vlasta are a true menace belied by their tiny size. Voraciously attacking foes in groups of up to a dozen-usually in the dark-the Swift One darts about making running leaps of up to twenty feet. Not afraid even of human-sized targets, Vlasta usually aim for the face to peck out the eyes. Luckily for the victims, these Eaters of Eyes have very fragile bones, easily crushed, and they remain dormant during the day in underground warrens.

Acute Senses : a Vlasta sees perfectly in darkness and may track with its excellent sense of smell (Scent 3; see page 353).

Disorientation : in broad daylight at the start of a Vlasta's turn, roll d10 against TN5; failure means reduce all its tests by one success level for one round.

Eye Gouge : when a Vlasta strikes the face location, roll d4 on the Face Option subtable (page 167). If it inflicts a Grievous Injury to an eye (either at once or through compounding), the eye is plucked out.

Torment (1-turn): the Umbath chitters unintelligibly, testing Torment against a target within 5 feet. A success imparts chaotic thoughts, forcing the victim to test Spirit (Torment CS -20 penalty):

Torment Example : an incarnated Umbath flitters about Nolora's head and shoulders, tormenting her with its babbling and twittering. The Torment test roll is 41-Success (S). The roll against Nolora's Spirit ML60 is 62-Failure (F); so she suffers two Psyche Stress Levels. The d10 roll against TN6 for the Umbath is 8 (failure), so it flies off, seemingly satisfied with the trauma inflected-or looking to find its pack and return.

Leaping Attack : a Vlasta always attempts leaping bite attacks against larger foes. With a Charge action, it automatically strikes Zone 1 of a human-sized target, and then centres its d6 location die around the face-see Eye Gouge (left).

Without a charge, a successful d10 roll against TN6 allows it to perform the Leaping Attack, as above. On a failed leap, a successful strike uses a d8+2 roll to determine the zone struck (thus, ZN3-10 against human-sized targets).

aberrance :	Ivashu	have	ABE	from	1	to	3. Truly	grotesque	physiologies	increase	it	by 1	or	2	more.	Usually	only	especially	malign spirits have	ABE	scores	of	6	or	more.

attributes : Strength (STR) is a function of	size	(mass).	Endurance	(END)	is	usually within	80%	of	the	STR	score,	but	can	equal or	exceed	it.	While	ABE	often	replaces Comeliness	(CML),	Ivashu	can	exhibit	all the	other	ten	attributes.	Simply	select	their scores	(1-20),	or	roll	1d6,	2d6,	or	3d6.

Scent (SNT) :	randomly	determine	a	Scent Index	by	rolling	2d6 - 2d6	(≤	0	means	none).

## ívashù generation

skills :	all	Ivashu	understand,	at	least telepathically,	the	Ivashi	language	(some might	speak	it);	most	have	Awareness, Initiative/Shock,	Spirit,	and	Stealth;	add others	as	appropriate	(Swimming,	Jumping).

Skill Base (SB) : use the SB as found on the Skills List table	(page	46).	Most	natural weapon	SB	are	AGL · WIL,	but	use	DEX · AGL for	the	claws	of	humanoid-like	arms.

Skill Base Factor (SBF) : when computing a SB	that	includes	STR	and/or	END,	multiply these	Attributes	by	the	special	SBF	listed in the Size table	(left).	This	gives	a	relative score	that	keeps	ML	near	the	1-100	range.

Skill Multiple (SM) : Initiative SM is given in the Behaviour table	(left).	Assign	SM	for other	skills	using	like	ranges,	according	to the	associated	behaviour.	Thus,	a blundering Ivashu has Stealth SM3; a sly one,	SM5 + 2	MB.

The	SM	of	the	primary	natural	weaponbite,	claw,	tail-is	the	same	as	for	Initiative. Perhaps	lower	'secondary'	weapons	by	1	SM.

mastery level :	figure	ML	as	usual:	SB	times SM	plus	any	Mastery	Boosts	(page	46).

move :	model	the	precise	score	after	a	similar existing	creature.

weapons : refer to the Creature Size table (page	401)	for	weapon	Zone	Dice	and	Reach. Natural	weapon	Impact	Dice	vary	by	three levels	of	lethality	(low,	moderate,	or	high), reflecting	their	size	or	imposingness:

| weapon   | low   | mod     | high   |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| bite [p] | d 4   | d 6 ar1 | d8 ar2 |
| claw[e]  | d 6-1 | d 8-1   | d 10-1 |
| tail [b] | d 6-4 | d 6-3   | d 6-2  |

To	get	the	final	weapon	impact,	modify the	above	Impact	Die	by	the	Strength Impact	Modifier	(page	97).	For	example,	the 'monstrous'	(high	lethality)	claws	of	a	STR26 Ivashu	inflict	d10 + 7 e ( d10 - 1 + 8	STR	mod ) .

hit location table : Zone Numbers (ZN) are	a	function	of	size	(see	page	401	table). Model the precise Hit Location table,	and its	various	Shock	Numbers	(1-5),	on	the	most appropriate	existing	example.

armour value :	AV	equals	Strength	Impact Modifier	adjusted	by	the	outer	covering:

| covering   |   b |   e |   p |   e |
|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| hair       |   0 |   1 |   0 |   1 |
| hide       |   1 |   2 |   1 |   3 |
| fur        |   3 |   2 |   1 |   3 |
| scales     |   3 |   5 |   4 |   2 |

Final	AV	is	highly	variable:	adjust	according to	Body	Location	(thin	or	thick	areas),	and refer	to	existing	creatures	as	models.

## wondrous traits
