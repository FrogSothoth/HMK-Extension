# Conspiracy

## Conspiracy

The second type of influence a character may wield is called conspiracy . Whereas persuasion occurs on a personal, immediate scale, conspiracy transpires more generally over several days or weeks and measures the character's ability to function within a subculture or settlement.

Quite often an entire adventure unfolds as a conspiracy, and so resolving it with a dice roll is likely not desirable. Instead, GMs can reserve the Conspiracy Routine for when players make unexpected decisions that might divert the game's focus or otherwise slow its progress. After a long series of roleplayed encounters and intricate character dialogue, sometimes it comes  as a relief to players for the narrative to move briskly-a dramatic revelation through a single conspiracy roll might very well reinvigorate everyone's attention.

## Conspiracy Routine

Conspiracies take place in a specific location, such as a town or manor village, a tribal gathering, or even a large, slow-moving caravan. Whatever the time and place, follow these steps to launch a conspiracy.

## [�] declare task

The conspirators describe their overall intent, usually either to gather information or instigate a plot.

Gather Information : the conspirator wishes to gain more knowledge about a recently living person or current event in the present location. Knowledge of the remote past instead tests Folklore (page 73), or language and script skills if it involves written works (page 83).

Instigate Plot : the conspirator wishes to initiate a scheme about a person or event in the present location. Instigating a plot might be viewed as the active inverse of gathering information-an 'offensive' attempt to create information about the subject that did not exist before. Such plots often include falsehoods but do not have to.

## [�] time

The time required to attempt a conspiracy varies by the size of the settlement or location. As a guide, assume it takes one day per Market Size, or just d6 hours in smaller places, such as manors or tribal villages. It really depends on the nature of the conspiracy-sometimes they could actually unfold more quickly in larger settlements.

## [3] conspiracy roll

A Conspiracy Roll is an Intrigue Success Value test by the principal agent involved. Other characters may lend assistance (page 60). Include these modifiers based on Language and Network.

Language : the character's fluency in a predominant local language modifies the SV result: limited, Index 0-2 (-1 SV); basic, Index 3-5 (0); advanced, Index 6-8 (+1 SV); or profound, Index 9 or more (+2 SV). If using a translator, use the translator's fluency and apply a further -2 to SV. Without the proper language or a translator, the agent cannot attempt the Conspiracy Roll. The GM might allow a conspirator to use a secondary local language, but with a reduction to the resulting SV modifier by an additional one or two.

Networks : characters attempting a conspiracy in unfamiliar subcultures could face other difficulties (see Networks, sidebar).

## networks

When characters test Intrigue to make Conspiracy Rolls, the GM might consider certain modifiers according to the subculture within which the agent acts.

Class : characters can have difficulty conspiring outside their social class, certainly among the extremes. This disadvantage can often work reciprocally: nobles can be exposed among peasants as much as the latter among their 'betters'. Consider applying a -1 SV penalty per difference in social class between the character and the target social class, according to the various Class tables in Chapter 2: Character (starting on page 27). The GM can include logical exceptions and gradations, as desired.

Family : reliance upon one's clan or family for assistance is often resolved with a Kinship Roll, which is a Success Level test against a character's Estrangement score (page 34 sidebar). The GM could resolve it instead as a Conspiracy Roll, with Estrangement replacing Intrigue in the Success Value test of step 3.

Occupation : to reflect character renown or reputation, a primary occupation skill ML can generate a Secondary Modifier to Conspiracy Rolls. Thus, a master weaponcrafter with ML94, but only Intrigue ML33, would make Conspiracy Rolls pertaining to the Weaponcrafters' Guild against an EML53 (Intrigue ML33 + 20 Secondary Modifier from Weaponcraft).

## conspiracy roll

## sv intrigue success value test

- ≤ 2 no effect : the	conspiracy	fails.
- 3-4 persuasion : the	conspiracy	fails	unless the	conspirator	tests	a	persuasion	skill. A success results in a one-star outcome (as	below).	On	a	failure,	the	character	is exposed	(F)	or	threatened	(CF).
- 5 1 outcome : the	conspiracy	succeeds.	Each
- increasing	star	result	reflects	better 6 2
- information	or	a	more	effective	plot. 7 3
- Proceed to step 4 for a more detailed 8 4
- explanation	(page	140). 9+ 5

Critical Failure : the	conspirator	risks	being exposed,	regardless	of	the	star	result	of	the	test itself.	The	player	selects	and	tests	one	of	the	five persuasion	skills	for	the	character	(page	137).	A failure	means	the	agent	is	found	out	(F),	perhaps with	violent	consequences	(CF).	Make	this persuasion	test	before	any	persuasion	test	made as	the	result	of	SV3-4-and	the	conspirator	may select	the	same	or	different	skills	for	each	test.

A Conspiracy Roll should not be like hammering a nail until successful;

## gather info example

Eldir, a secret Peonian mendicant, arrives in the enemy-controlled castle town of Menekai ( mkt 2). Eldir needs to find out how heavy the patrols are to the north before venturing to the outlying manor village of Cozune a few days away. His player announces a Conspiracy Roll to gather information about the patrols, knowing the violent mounted Agrikan knights could prove quite troublesome.

The GM decides to make the roll after some roleplaying of exactly how the player wishes to proceed. Eldir's player guides her character around the village, making several inquiries, and ultimately arriving at a local tavern known to be connected to the regional Lia-Kavair (the 'thieves' guild'). The GM and player roleplay several exchanges over a period of two game days, and then the GM calls for the roll.

Eldir speaks Harnic at a basic level (Index 5) and has Intrigue ML48. The player rolls 65-a CF that results in SV3. The Critical Failure note at the bottom of the Conspiracy Roll table (page 139) says Eldir must make a Persuasion test or risk exposure. The player selects Command ML52, to see if he can intimidate his way out of the mess: a 32 succeeds (S). The SV3 result gives him the option to improve the failed conspiracy to a one-star result. The player declines the risk, so nothing is learned.

## instigate plot example

Elben is a resident scholar at the Guild of Arcane Lore in the port city of Cherafir in the Kingdom of Melderyn. Having just returned from a long journey up the Silver Way to the dwarven Kingdom of Azadmere, Elben has been asked by his travelling companion, Nolora, to continue their journey, across the Emel Straits to her homeland of Emelrene.

This juncture takes place during a pause in the gaming group's campaign. The GM has called for two months 'downtime' in the world after the adventure on the Silver Way. The GM reminds Elben's player that his PC has recently benefited from the guild's granting him leave; his masters will need more convincing to let him go to Emelrene.

Elben's player decides he will Instigate Plot to persuade the guild. The GM agrees, feeling this is a good time to keep the campaign's pace swift, for, indeed, several recent developments point to the Jerinalian Mountains in eastern Emelrene. The player describes Elben making his case the next few weeks that his travelling to Emelrene is diplomatically crucial, but no scenes are roleplayed.

The GM calls for an Intrigue SV test for Elben, with Elben the target of his own plot. Against ML76, the roll is 61 (S) and a three-star result. The plot works and the GM decides that the 'unrelated social strata' mentioned in the table refer to political entities in Melderyn that, in fact, encourage Elben to travel to Emelrene, home to recent dragon sightings in Nolora's native lands…

## [4] outcome

A successful conspiracy has a rating between one and five stars. The GM may interpret them as either quality or quantity , or a combination of both. For guidance and inspiration, consult the following star scale tables according to the conspiracy type:

## gather information

- 1 Vague	or	third-party	evidence	reveals	a	single	piece	of	general	information,	little better	than	rumour.
- 2 Direct	evidence	or	a	trustworthy	witness	imparts	several	broad	facts	about	the subject-or	one	detailed	piece	of	news.
- 3 Several	specific	pieces	of	information	give	a	good	understanding	of	the	subject; this	might	include	implications	not	initially	imagined	or	sought	after.
- 4 A	complete,	deep	picture	of	the	subject	is	uncovered;	it	very	likely	includes information	not	widely	known	by	the	public	at	large.
- 5 Secrets	or	details	well	beyond	what	was	expected	are	revealed	in	volume; powerful	or	damning	leverage	is	likely	gained.

## instigate plot

- 1 Innuendo	tangential	to	the	subject	is	established;	while	not	widely	or	deeply believed,	the	plot	at	least	resonates	as	rumour.
- 2 A	single	idea	takes	firm	hold	among	those	of	the	targeted	social	stratum;	the general	populace	likely	views	it	as	simple	rumour.
- 3 Nuanced	and	substantial	information	is	clearly	linked	to	the	plot's	target,	even reaching	unrelated	social	strata	as	truth.
- 4 A	complicated	and	consequential	plot	with	wide	implications	is	linked;	all	but the	most	bizarre	details	are	believed	by	nearly	everyone.
- 5 An	intricate,	far-reaching,	and	highly	resonate	plot	is	linked;	some	details	might be	outlandish	or	esoteric	but	are	nonetheless	believed.

## revelation

The GM can reveal the details of the conspiracy in two ways, or in combination with each other.

Gameplay : the Conspiracy Roll is made, and then the GM shares the details through successive roleplay encounters. Done this way, the test sets the stage for much of the gaming session that follows.

Handout : the GM immediately doles out the result, either verbally or literally presenting it as a written handout.

## repeated conspiracy

A Conspiracy Roll  should not be like hammering a nail until successful; a single test should be consequential. Until a fair amount of time has passed-perhaps a month-the result of the initial roll should stand.
