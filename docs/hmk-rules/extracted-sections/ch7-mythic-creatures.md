# Mythic Creatures

## Mythic Creatures

The differences between animals, Ivashu, and mythic creatures are not always clear even though all are considered beasts. The Ivashu lack much of the instinct for self-preservation possessed by the other two, routinely expressing mindless aggression. On the other hand, mythic creatures often share with Ivashu similar wondrous bodies and arcane characteristics absent in animals. Thus, in the taxonomy of beasts, mythic creatures are usually situated between animals and the Fatherless Multitude. Those prevalent in Venarive, such as the seven detailed in this section, come in two types: the fabled and the chimaeric .

## Fabled Beasts

By definition, mythic creatures are remembered through stories. However, some beasts hold an ancient, even prehistoric and reverential place in a people's collective memory. Such fabled creatures can be majestic and beautiful-even when also terrifying. These beasts usually lack the grotesque bodies of Ivashu and are more easily integrated into what people accept as natural, or nearly so.

Dragons : great serpent-like beasts, many of whom fly and breathe fire or frost; common in some variation to the myths of nearly all cultures. Unicorns : a type of magical equine closely allied with the Ælrhin, likely limited to the forested wilderness of northwest Venarive.

Wargs : huge, cunning wolves often associated with the same forests that shelter unicorns.

Wýrhin : scaled flying creatures, perhaps smaller cousins of dragons.

Yélgri : humanoid flying creatures called harpies ; known for their screeching voices and pestering behaviour.

## Chimaeric Beasts

The mythic creatures most often confused with Ivashu are literal hybrids of two or more animals-the chimaeras . They are usually 'fused' at the midsection, with each end exhibiting the characteristics of a familiar beast. While chimaeras are ancient species, scholars speculate they are younger than fabled creatures like dragons, perhaps created by the Earthmasters or some forgotten magic. Their appearance can be quite unsettling, and so most folk deem them monstrous-feared rather than revered.

Gryphons : an eagle-lion hybrid that favour preying on horses; found in many regions of Kethira.

Hiréni : an omnivorous but skittish eagle-horse hybrid that hunt in highlands throughout the world.

## cultural variation

The mythic creatures detailed in this section are all found in northwest Lythia, several appearing throughout the world. Other geographical areas and cultures express their own variation of mythic creatures, many of which will be detailed in future publications.

Anzelôria : the tropical sub-continent south of the Venarian Sea contains many distinctive natural animals and mythic creatures. Aside from the mundane-such as elephants, giraffes, panthers, and lions-there is the strange: the jinmuaji of the deep jungle, enormous 30-foot crocodiles that can rear up and walk on hind legs; or the sub-tropical ardomito , 10-foot tortoises with impenetrable shells. Anzeloria also has its tales of ravaging dragons of the Yanda mountains.

Shóju : this land off the coast of far eastern Lythia has a rich mythology of creatures. The ishunai are spirit-monsters of Lake Ishu and the Xhoukun Mountains, immortal and semidivine in the eyes of folk.

## unique entities

Most mythic creatures are a species of beasts, capable of reproduction and appearing in numbers, however rarely. By contrast, some are singular entities, unknown to exist beyond their unique, one expression.

Ægesíri : the folk of Karejia, the island realm of the eastern Venarian Sea, speak of a huge variety of mythic, perhaps 'divine' creatures, such as disfigured giants, beautiful animals, three-headed sea monsters, and bizarre near-humans. Each such Ægesir is unique unto itself, capable of being killed but also reappearing reincarnated as itself within years or decades after dying. They are each closely tied to a particular geographical spot, and many have oracular powers.

Pradeyálkri : unique beings in northwest Venarive similar to the Ægesiri, the Pradeyalkri are 'semi-divine' beings who express extraordinary powers and come in a variety of guises. The Oracle of Silmer River in Emelrene is a hooded figure who professes augurs in a whispered voice. The rugged Noron of Hârn appears as a mighty seven-foot-tall human, a hunter of orcs known to offer peaceful travellers respite at his wilderness keep.

## dragons

## Drakes

Dragons are a reptilian-like species that legend says descended from the mating of Ahnu and Dhivu, two demigods from the time of conflict that followed the Natal Wars. They are probably the oldest, most powerful creatures on Kethira but are seldom seen during the lifetimes of most folk, save the Ælrhin. More often, their existence is simply not believed.

However rare and elusive, dragons in fact do exist, as historic accounts and even contemporary witnesses attest. There are likely fewer than six hundred dragons left in the entire world, with different varieties-perhaps subspeciesfound in many locales and geographies.

In Venarive, dragons come in two types-the Ahnerin and the Dhiverin . Also called fire dragons, the Ahnerin have red-hued scales and a Natural Attunement to fire principle. The Dhiverin, or frost dragons, have blueblack scales and a similar attunement to water principle, especially its associated cold element. Scholars posit there might be even more kinds reflecting all the Pvaric principles.

A dragon's lithe and serpentine shape belies a colossal strength that continues to grow throughout its immensely long life. Although about two feet long when hatched, a young dragon grows to over 15 feet after 50 years, and the mature adult averages 25 feet within a century. An old dragon tops out at 40 feet during a span of several hundred years or more. Some annals describe ancient examples living five hundred years, the mightiest even approaching a millennium and reaching a length in excess of 60 feet. Whatever its age, a dragon's proportions remain fairly constant: about 60% of its length is in the tail and neck, and its wingspan is usually about 150% of its length.

Dragons inhabit wilderness regions that offer a highland perch. They prefer to live in the security of caves, above the treeline, where they remain protected during their long rests. Ahnerin often seek out brimstone deposits or volcanic peaks; Dhiverin prefer the cold wastes of high altitude or northern reaches. While sparsely populated throughout the lands of the world, dragons are territorial, and competition and even conflict can suddenly arise between them over the most ideal locations.

While dragons have exceptionally long lives, much of it is spent in what appears to be deep slumber. When young, such dormancy can last three months out of the year  -or even for stretches up to a whole year. Afterwards they emerge to feed a hunger that is strangely less than their body size would imply. As dragons age, the dormant period greatly increases in proportion to the waking, active time. Very old dragons can spend three years slumbering for every four months awake.

But a dragon is not simply sleeping when it enters a dormant state. Rather, it has arcanely shifted inhabitation and perspective from the body in the physical world to the soul in the spirit world. The dragon then undertakes an astral journey to seek out its attuned principle. Upon finding it-fire energy for Ahnerin, cold energy for Dhiverin-the dragon enters Spirit Immersion for nourishment, renewal, and peace of mind. Many scholars believe that such immersions are what actually spur the dragon's growth and extend its life.

If not literally made of magic force, a dragon's existence is directly fuelled by it. The vast, hermetic periods of dormancy largely explain their remove from the affairs of folk. It is not a lack of might that prevents wanton destruction of cities and castles, but an unnervingly unpredictable and intermittent disinterest.

Arcane Talents : some chroniclers describe dragons as casting spells; what they actually witness are the effects of draconic arcane talents. In most respects, such talents function like other invocations, including the chance for fatigue accrual and Aural Shock. The long bouts of astral immersion seem to increase a dragon's talent mastery.

Breath Weapon : however uncanny, a dragon's breath weapon cannot be dispelled-it functions in some mundane, yet wondrous manner (see page 388 for the breath weapon attack routine).

Drakes : dragons without arcane talent are called drakes . While roughly the same size as the arcane kind, they lack the ability to go dormant and rarely live beyond 100-150 years. Some are even flightless or have no breath weapon.

Flying : unless leaping from a high peak, young and mature dragons must make a full Move and successfully test Agility to get airborne (see page 353 for details on how flying functions in combat).

Gliding : given their enormous size, old dragons manage flight only from a precipitous leap. On the ground, the running Agility test that normally gets it airborne now simply results in a tenuous, surface-level glide. This probably explains why old dragons rarely venture down from their mountain homes-to avoid the arduous return on foot.

Most dragons possess special Arcane Talents . Make	a	d20	roll	to	determine	if	and	how many	talents	it	has:

## d20 arcane talents

| 1     | none(drake)                  |
|-------|------------------------------|
| 2-5   | communicate,dormancy,enthral |
| 6-10  | as2-5plusonerandom(below)    |
| 11-12 | as2-5plustworandom(below)    |
| 13-14 | as2-5plusthreerandom(below)  |
| 15-16 | as2-5plusfourrandom(below)   |
| 17-18 | as2-5plusfiverandom(below)   |
| 19-20 | as2-5plussixrandom(below)    |

communicate : the dragon can send a telepathic thought to some or all conscious beings	within	AUR × 10	yards.	It	understands audible	speech	similarly	but	cannot	read silent	thoughts.	The	talent	requires	no invocation.	It	does	not	affect	the	dragon's Eloquence (ELO)-some are still more persuasive	than	others.

dormancy : dragons test Talent to inhabit their	soul	in	the	spirit	world.	They	guard their lair with Spirit (Sensing) tests and use Spirit (Immersion) to	bond	with	energy. Dragons	can	'slumber'	this	way	for	a	very long	time-sometimes	for	years,	the	period increasing	with	age.

enthral : as a free action at the start of its	turn,	the	dragon	gazes	into	the	eyes	of a	creature	within	AUR × 5	feet	and	LOS.	If the Talent Invocation	Roll	succeeds,	the target	may	resist	with	a	higher Spirit test success	level	(break	ties).	Otherwise,	the target is stunned until the end of its next turn.	Another	successful	Spirit	test	ends	the effect	(-10	penalty	per	Enthral	victory	star). Targets	may	retest	Spirit	each	round.

A d20 result of 6 or higher means the dragon has the three above talents plus the given number of d20 rolls on this table for additional	ones,	according	to	dragon	type:

| d20   | áhnerintalent   | dhíverin talent   |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1-2   | dormancy        | chilling visage   |
| 3-4   | dryair          | dormancy          |
| 5-8   | enthral         | enthral           |
| 9-10  | ethereal heat   | ethereal cold     |
| 11-12 | etherealsmoke   | ethereal darkness |
| 13-14 | exhaustingwave  | gloomwave         |
| 15-16 | fiery visage    | ice ball          |
| 17-18 | fire burst      | stasis            |
| 19-20 | speed burst     | stillness         |

The	Talent	ML	in	the	dragon's	skills	list	(page 388)	is	used	for	all	invocation	tests.	Each talent	duplicated	by	a	d20	roll	gives	it	a Mastery	Boost	and	its	own	separate	ML.

Talent Index is abbreviated TI in the following	entries.

## áhnerin unique talents

Ahnerin	may	test one talent per turn as a free action but otherwise follow the Invocation Routine	(page	259).	They	are	immune	to	the negative	effects	resulting	from	their	own successful	talent	invocations.

dry air : the air around the dragon out to	TI × 5	feet	becomes	parched,	making	it difficult	to	breath.	Creatures	within	it	who exert	themselves	(such	as	by	fighting	or running) must succeed on a d10 roll against END	Index	at	the	end	of	their	turn	or	suffer	5 fatigue.	The	effect	lasts	TI	rounds.

ethereal heat : the air surrounding the dragon	in	a	TI × 100-foot	radius	becomes hotter.	The	area	remains	where	first	created, even	if	the	dragon	moves.	Creatures	suffer a	Heat	Hazard	(page	149)	every	hour	they remain	within	it.	The	heated	air	lasts	TI	days.

ethereal smoke :	the	dragon's	body	is engulfed	in	wispy	ethereal	smoke	for	TI rounds.	The	cloud	is	centred	on	its	body	in a	diameter	of	TI × 5	feet,	moving	with	the dragon.	While	the	smoke	does	not	block LOS,	it	does	impart	-20	penalty	to	attacks against the dragon or to Awareness tests in or	through	it.

exhausting wave : an enervating wave bursts out from the dragon in all directions to	a	range	of	TI × 5	feet.	All	creatures	within it oppose the invocation with an Endurance test,	suffering	10	fatigue	for	each	victory	star of	the	dragon's	Talent	test.

fiery visage :	the	dragon's	body	briefly glows	red-black	from	within,	especially around	and	in	its	eyes.	The	effect	forces creatures	looking	at	it	within	200	feet	to make	a	Fear	Roll	(page	187)	with	a	penalty equal	to	half	TI × 5 .

fire burst :	the	dragon	invokes	this	talent while	drawing	on	its	breath	weapon,	all	as a	1-turn	action	that	also	allows	a	flying	full Move.	With	a	successful	invocation,	the dragon	spits	a	TI-foot	diameter	ball	of	fire out	to	TI × 50	feet.	If	the	ball	strikes	an	object or	a	creature,	it	explodes	with	a	diameter of	half	TI × 5	feet.	Creatures	may	avoid	the initial missile if their Dodge success level exceeds	the	invocation's.	Any	creature caught	in	the	explosion	suffers	an	Area attack	of	d4 + TI	fire	impact	(CS	+5	impact). The	ball	vanishes	if	it	does	not	strike	an object	or	creature	within	range.

speed burst :	the	dragon's fly Move (page 388)	increases	for	one	round	by	TI × 10	(CS ×20)	feet.

## dhíverin unique talents

Dhiverin	may	test one talent per turn as a free action but otherwise must follow the Invocation	Routine	(page	259).	They	are immune	to	the	negative	effects	resulting from	their	own	successful	talent	invocations.

chilling visage :	the	dragon's	body	briefly glows	icy-white	from	within,	especially around	and	in	its	eyes.	The	effect	forces creatures	looking	at	it	within	200	feet	to make	a	Fear	Roll	(page	187)	with	a	penalty equal	to	half	TI × 5 .

ethereal cold : the air surrounding the dragon	in	a	TI × 100-foot	radius	becomes colder.	The	area	remains	where	first	created, even	if	the	dragon	moves.	Creatures	suffer a	Cold	Hazard	(page	149)	every	hour	they remain	within	it.	The	frigid	air	lasts	Talent TI	days.

ethereal darkness :	the	dragon's	body is	engulfed	in	streaks	of	darkness	for	TI rounds.	The	area	is	centred	on	the	dragon's body	in	a	diameter	of	TI × 5	feet,	moving with	the	dragon.	While	the	darkness	does not	block	LOS,	it	does	impart	-20	penalty	to attacks	against	the	dragon	or	to	Awareness tests	in	or	through	it.

gloom wave :	a	shadowy,	entropic	cloud with	a	diameter	of	TI × 5	feet	is	centred	on the	dragon's	body,	even	while	moving.	LOS is	unaffected,	but	move	costs	double	and strike	impacts	are	halved	for	anyone	within it.	The	effect	lasts	TI	rounds.

ice ball :	the	dragon	invokes	this	talent while	drawing	on	its	breath	weapon,	all as	a	1-turn	action	that	also	allows	a	flying full	Move.	With	a	successful	invocation, the dragon spits a TI-foot diameter ball of ice	out	to	TI × 50	feet.	If	the	ball	strikes	an object	or	a	creature,	then	it	explodes	with a	diameter	of	half	TI × 5	feet.	Creatures may	avoid	the	initial	missile	if	their Dodge success	level	exceeds	the	invocation's.	Any creature	caught	in	the	explosion	suffers an	Area	attack	of	d4 + TI	frost	impact	(CS +5	impact).	The	ball	vanishes	if	it	does	not strike	an	object	or	creature	within	range.

stasis :	the	bleeding	of	one	of	the	dragon's injuries	is	halted	for	TI	hours.	If	the	dragon	is able	to	enter	Spirit	Immersion,	the	bleeding is	permanently	stopped.

stillness :	the	air	immediately	surrounding the	dragon	absorbs	sound	for	TI	hours. Other	creatures	suffer	-1	success	level	to PER and Awareness tests when attempting to	hear	noises	caused	by	or	emanating	from the	dragon,	such	as	the	flapping	of	wings.

The	Zone	Reach	Penalties	only	apply	against rearing dragons;	otherwise,	any	ZN	can	be	the	default	aim	for	human-sized	strikers,	depending	upon	positioning. Dragons are immune to f -impact	trauma	that	corresponds	to	their	natural	attunement:	Ahnerin	(fire);	Dhiverin	(frost).

## breath weapon attack

Dragons can make an Area attack with a gout of fire (Ahnerin) or frost (Dhiverin). At the start of its turn, the dragon tests Breath to see if it is ready to discharge.

## breath weapon test

cf idle 2 rounds f idle 1 round

s ready to discharge cs ready to discharge (+5 impact)

Failure means the fire or frost lies idle for the indicated time, and the dragon selects a different action for the current turn. It then retests Breath on a later round. A dragon may only try a Breath weapon attack on the turn of its Initiative Rank (IR), never with a bonus Action TA.

Glide Attack : a dragon can discharge the breath weapon during the same turn of a flying full Move. When grounded, a moving breath attack is limited to the usual half Move Charge option.

With a Breath success the dragon can immediately emit the fire/frost as a 1-turn action (if it declines to, it must retest on later turns-it cannot hold the attack). The dragon weapon tables list the extent of the cone, varying according to Age Group [40-80 feet]. The breath inflicts d4 impact plus a modifier based upon range.

Example : a mature dragon's breath does d4 + 15 f impact out to 20 feet; d4 + 11 f from 21 to 40 feet; and d4 + 7 f from 41 to 60 feet.

The first 20 feet of the cone is five feet in diameter. Each additional 20-foot swath increases the diameter by five more feet. The cone fully affects all targets whose spaces are at least 50% within the area (see diagram, right).

Example : a mature dragon's breath is 60 feet long. The first 20 feet inflicts an area attack to all targets in a 5-foot width; the second 20-foot band is ten feet in diameter; and the last 20-foot section is 15 feet wide.

## dragon encounter sequence

A	dragon's	actions	during	an	encounter	vary according	to	whether	the	contact	takes	place in its lair or in the surrounding wilderness . Even just reaching such remote areas can prove	perilous	for	characters.

## lair

The	dragon	is	likely	'sleeping',	inhabiting	the spirit	world.	Its	active	soul	usually	remains in	the	astral	locale	of	its	lair,	testing Spirit (Sensing) to	notice	the	souls	of	physical world	intruders	(-40	penalty	from	the target's	dormant	soul	and	unfamiliarity,	plus target's	AUR	modifier).	If	successful,	the dragon	tries	to	reembody	(page	298).

- With	enough	time,	the	dragon	then	leaves its	lair	and	takes	flight	(see	step	1,	below).
- If	trapped	within	the	lair,	it	attacks	with	its breath	weapon	and	engages	aggressively in	melee	in	hopes	of	escaping	(steps	2-5).

## wilderness

The	dragon	is	usually	hunting	or	in	the process	of	feeding,	both	bringing	a	hostile response	to	interlopers.	Most	dragons	in	the wilderness	are	encountered	in	flight	(step	1).

- There is a slight chance the dragon could be engaged with another dragon in a territorial	dispute.	Characters	risk	drawing the	attention	of	both.

## 1 flight

The	air	is	a	dragon's	most	natural,	physical world	habitat.	In	flight	it	observes	potential meals	and	possible	invaders.	Being	aloft	also gives	it	ample	opportunity	to	invoke	arcane talents	(step	2).

- Although	dragons	can	make	terrifying double	Move	plunges,	they	tend	to soar at a full Move in order still to express their breath weapon.
- A	dragon	in	flight would	likely	only	land after	a	successful use of its breath weapon,	when	targets	seem sufficiently	'softened'.

## 2 arcane talents

Since	it	invokes	as	a	free	action,	a	dragon with	arcane	talents	uses	them	often, hesitating	only	after	gaining	10	or	more fatigue.

- It	usually	starts	with	Fiery/Chilling	Visage.
- In	its	lair,	the	dragon	masks	itself	with Ethereal	Smoke/Darkness,	or	Stillness.
- In	the	wilderness,	it	overcomes	prey	with Exhausting,	Gloom	Wave,	or	Speed	Burst.
- In	melee	at	the	start	of	its	turn,	the	dragon always	targets	a	foe	with	Enthral.

## 3 breath weapon

The	cone	of	fire	or	frost	is	not	meant	to obliterate targets but rather to incapacitate them for the dragon to resolve melee  more easily.	When	flying,	it	makes	a	Glide	Attack, circling	around	when	the	breath	is	idle.

- Targets : when sighting a dragon within its	striking	distance,	characters	are	wise	to select	the	Evade	action	(page	166).	Then,	if targeted	with	the	breath	attack,	they	have the chance to test Dodge to reduce the area	attack's	resulting	shock.

The GM might allow targets of a longdistance	Glide	Attack	to	test	Initiative	in order	to	select	the	Evade	action	proactively in	anticipation	of	the	breath	attack.

## 4 press

After	a	successful	Breath	attack	from	aloft, the	dragon	on	its	next	turn	takes	a	flying Charge	action	to	make	a	Press	attack, barrelling	over	smaller	prey.	Once	grounded, it	then	begins	melee	(step	5).

- Overrun :	while	preferring	to	be	airborne, dragons on the ground can ignore the Engagement	Zones	of	two	(Young),	five (Mature),	or	ten	(Old)	human-sized opponents,	moving	readily	around	to	find the	most	powerful	foe	to	attack.

## 5 melee

A	dragon	commits	ferociously	to	melee.

- At	the	start	of	every	turn,	as	a	free	action,	it tests	Enthral	against	the	closest	threat.
- As	its	action	option,	the	dragon	makes a Bite attack,	preferably	against	a	foe stunned	by	Enthral.	Its	head	zone	likely	has enough	AV	to	mitigate	impact	resulting from the Natural Weapons disadvantage against	a	foe's	armed	block	(page	171).
- In	melee	defence,	the	dragon	rears	up and	stretches	its	head	away	from	foes, counterstriking with a Claw or Tail ,	both considered	Mighty	Strikes	page	353).	Its Body Location table	reflects	this	position.
- When	victorious	in	attack	or	defence,	the dragon	always	accepts	the	free	Press	Roll against	smaller	targets	(page	172).

Targets :	characters	attacking	a	dragon	in melee	can	often	only	aim	at	the	dragon's head	without	penalty	when	defensively counterstriking	its	Bite	attack.	Otherwise, characters	attacking	on	their	own	turn usually	face	a	rearing	dragon,	which	reduces the	reach	of	high-aimed	strikes	(see	Zone Reach	Penalty,	page	352).

## gryphon Griffin · Mârenu

3'-4' height (sh.)  · 5'-6' long · 300 lbs  medium The gryphon-or griffinis an eagle-lion chimaera, possessing the head, wings, and forelegs of an eagle and the body and hind legs of a lion. It has pale brown to golden feathers and fur with darker, sometimes black, wing tips. Gryphons live in most mountains of Lythia, preying on grazing animals, especially horses. Unless provoked, they usually avoid folk.

Frighten Horses : horses must make a Fear roll when they perceive a gryphon. In addition to the results of this test, a horse mount imparts -20 penalty to its rider's Control rolls for an hour. 40

Glide : a gryphon achieves a soaring flight only by leaping from great heights. On the ground, it must make a full Move and succeed on an AGL test to achieve a slow, low-level glide (at half Fly 100). STEALTH

LN

Wing-pounce : Gryphons flap their wings to rear up and pounce on their foes. A beak or talon attack includes a d10  roll against TN7. Success grants an Action TA for a claw attack against the same target, who may only try to Dodge in defence.

## hirénu Hippogriff 3 2 3 02

4' height (shoulder)  · 8' long · 500 lbs  large The Hirenu-or hippogriff -is an eaglehorse chimaera, possessing the head, wings, and forelegs of an eagle and the body and hind legs of a small horse. They are usually bay, roan, or sometimes grey or even white. The omnivorous Hireni live in highlands and canyons where they hunt goat, deer, or boar and forage nuts, seeds, and leaves. While fearsomelooking, they can be timid in the face of aggressive foes.

Glide : Hireni usually achieve true flight by leaping from great heights. From the ground, if they make a full Move and succeed on an AGL test, they achieve a low-level glide (half Fly 100).

Screech : Hippogriffs have an ear-piercing screech that causes surprised foes to make a Fear roll (page 187).

Trample : when moving over a prone target, a Hirenu may make one kick attack with -10 penalty. See Animal Special Abilities (page 354) for the entire Trample description.

## unicorn Êrmael

4'8" high (shoulder) · 7' long · 7�� lbs large

Unicorns have folk-like intelligence, empathy, and morality, and live in groups of a half dozen in isolated temperate woodlands. All have horns-the mightiest are bronze- or golden-hued, a foot long, spiralled, and perfectly straight. Unicorn colouration varies as much as that of horses, and the coat of a grey stallion turns glossy white by the end of winter. They often tend taur-im-aina (elven holy groves) or reside in the lællyn (ethereal zones) of Emelrene. This association likely explains their aural and spiritual strength.

Gore : a successful horn strike after a charge receives a +5 bonus to impact.

Horn : the horn is an enchanted weapon. If it is struck or used to block, the unicorn suffers neither injury nor shock. By touching its own or another's injury with the horn, the unicorn may impart the effect of an AS 6 Healing elixir (page 272).

Trample : when moving over a prone target, a unicorn may make one kick attack. See Animal Special Abilities (page 354) for the entire Trample description.

4' high · 6' long · �4� lbs  medium Folklore tells of wolves of great size, speed, ferocity, and cunning. Such dire wolves -known as wargs in many placeslive deep within thick forests, stalking alone or leading large packs of regular wolves. The legend of the Horned Hunter in Emelrene places wargs among the mysterious group of creatures said to hunt on nights of no moon. Led by a greygreen man or centaur, the pack is often associated with Vanaer, the Emhle god of the night who shares aspect with Naveh. ML

Canine Telepathy : a successful Telepathy invocation gives the warg projected communication with other wargs, wolves, and dogs within Talent Index × 100 feet for Index rounds. Reception is automatic.

Frighten Dogs : domesticated dogs must make a Fear roll (page 187) when they perceive a warg. On a CF 0, a dog attacks its handler until the Will test succeeds (it becomes catatonic if no handler is present). No matter the Fear response, there is a -2o penalty to Control rolls while the dog perceives the warg, and for 10 minutes beyond.

## w´yrè Wyvern

1�' long · 18' wingspan · 6�� lbs  large

Wyrhin look like two-legged, orange to dark brown dragons. While mistaken for young drakes, wyverns have a much lighter, more serpentine body. They walk awkwardly, flapping their wings to help move. Wyrhin live in the same mountainous areas as gryphons and hirenu and compete with them in hunting goats and domestic animals. They are aggressive and territorial and like to make diving surprise attacks.

SKILLS

ML

Flight : unless leaping from a high peak, a wyre must make a full Move and successfully test AGL to get airborne.

Poison : about one in four wyverns have a barbed tail that delivers poison on a penetrating strike. A victim who fails the injury's accompanying Shock Roll is paralysed d6 minutes (F) or d6 rounds (CF) later [HP 10 minutes · HR6 - IL].

Wing-pounce : Wyrhin flap their wings to rear up and pounce on their foes. A bite attack includes a d10  roll against TN5. Success grants an Action TA for a talon attack against the same target, who may only try to Dodge in defence.

## yélgri Harpy

4' tall · 7� lbs · 1�' wingspan  small

Some consider the Yelgri to be a debased type of folk because they wield primitive weapons and communicate in strange coos and loud screeches. However, their carnivorous predation and skittish brutality place them well outside most folkish norms, closer to that of Garguntheir own hated predator.

The clamorous harpies exhibit a dull, pinkish-grey skin and thick hair on the scalp and down the spine. They use an almost prehensile tail to balance while roosting and to stabilise their nimble flight. Groups of up to a dozen Yelgri are found among the forested mountainsides of all climates throughout most of Lythia.

Melee : while they have clawed hands and feet, Yelgri prefer to use crude javelins and sticks (-1 WQ and impact).

Stone Throwing : Yelgri throw small stones with a base range of 20 feet (d6 ZD at Point Blank and d8 ZD at Direct range). With arms independent of their wings, they can make flying, diving throws at a greater distance (BR 60 feet) and impact (+2 bonus) than that listed.

The	Zone	Reach	Penalty	2	applies	only	to	humansized	melee	strikes	against	a rearing wyvern,	not against one stretched out	horizontally.

<!-- image -->

Wýrè Poison Example : a Wyre strikes Azdar with its poison-tipped barbed tail in his left thigh for an S2 p injury. His Shock Roll is 98, a failure (F) that does not even stun him (SHK 6), but he will be paralyzed in 4 minutes (determined by a d6 roll). Then every 10 minutes beyond, Azdar tests HB × HR4 on the Exposure Healing Roll table (page 185). The paralysis ends at HR6.

The Zone Reach Penalty 2 applies only to human- sized melee strikes against a rearing wyvern, not

against one stretched out horizontally.
