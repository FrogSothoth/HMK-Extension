ost natives of venarive assume that the future will look very much like the past. Rivers may change their course, cities wax and wane and turn to dust, but the things that follow will be mostly like the things that came before. Thus, there is little thought given to changing the world. Scholars do not expect to revolutionise their fields, warlords look to one conquest at a time-save for the occasional effort to restore a long-lost empire. There is tremendous respect, even veneration, for past masters. Those people looking for power-whether arcane, economic, or political-expect to find it only in the framework provided by their predecessors.

However, there is one type of person whose ambitions are not bound by convention, who believes that revolutionary change is possible, and who believes that they succeed or fail based on their own capabilities and not the morality of their actions or their relationship to their god. These men and women are condemned by their mental defects to live outside normal society-in fact, to be constantly engaged in dangerous and often violent action. While they might find brief respite at times, and even achieve some temporary social status, they are driven by demons that keep them from long enjoying such times of rest. They are called adventurers, and they are a rude and unreasonable kind.
