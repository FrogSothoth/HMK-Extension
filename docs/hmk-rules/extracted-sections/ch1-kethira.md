# Kèthîra

## kèthîra

The HârnMaster game is set in the world called Kethira , a planet very close in size and nature to our own. It is the second of five planets of the star Nolomar, with an average diameter around 11,500 km and an orbital period of a fraction over 360 days. A common calendar-the Tuzyn Reckoning ( tr )-divides the year into twelve months of 30 days each, with three tenday weeks per month. The current date is 1 Nuzyæl tr 720, the first day of the year.

## the land

The map on page 10 displays the natural vegetation of Kethira's three continents: Kamerand, Lythia, and Mernat.

## Kámerand

Having the greatest north-south extent, Kamerand expresses highly varied climate and vegetation. Its many cultures are dominated by the brutal Yerazai, the 'Golden People' of the central western coast. Kamerand remains a fabled, virtually unknown land to other Kethirans.

## L´ythia

Easily the largest of the three continents, Lythia has every type of climate and vegetation, and a large diversity of cultures. Three areas on its periphery-Anzeloria, Molkur, and Venarive-are of special note.

Anzelôria : the southwestern subcontinent of Lythia sits across the equator, its rainforests and savannahs sparsely populated. The ancient civilisations of Anzeloria have remained largely isolated and guarded.

Molkûr : the southeast region of Lythia is mostly covered by subtropical rainforests. Its ancient ziggurat culture is believed to have influenced greatly the practice and spread of the arcane arts throughout the rest of the continent.

Venârivè : the name of the northwestern part of Lythia is a portmanteau of two prominent waters-the Venarian Sea and the Sea of Ivae. Venarive includes the northern coast of Anzeloria and the largely desert island of Hepeker. While all climates are represented, its sizeable temperate zones have fostered wide-ranging empires and kingdoms.

Hârnic Isles : the over 300 islands in the furthest northwest reach of Lythia include rugged and mist-shrouded Hârn, the largest island of the group.

## Mêrnat

The third continent of Kethira consists mostly of desert and grasslands. Mernat's scant population lives harmoniously with nature, its societies having resisted colonisation from the Yerazai of Kamerand but 400 miles to the east.

## kéthrian family of worlds

Kethira is at the crossroads of six other worlds, all collectively known as the 'Seven Worlds' or the 'Kethrian Family'.

Blessed Realm : home to the god Siem and destination of the elves when they leave Kethira and Midgaad.

Lósenor : a place of incandescent red gas, a lost 'world' said to be where the ancient Earthmasters came from.

Midgaad : the moderately magic-strong 'Middle Realm' where the Ælrhin (elven-folk) and Dârzulim (dwarven-folk) of Kethira probably originated.

Sherém : a world not unlike Kethira, yet also everchanging and truly enigmatic.

Terra : the near-zero-magic world whose technology is thought to be incompatible with magic.

Yàsháin : the embattled world of gods, demigods, and divine heroes, where the souls of Kethirans are believed by most to go upon death.

## the water

Oceans and seas, including two polar ice packs, cover more than three-quarters of Kethira's surface. These are its primary waters:

Haónic Ocean : the northern current of this mighty ocean brings the warm waters of tropical Kamerand to Lythia, moderating the climates of its northwestern realms.

Melûrian Sea : off the southeastern coast of Lythia, these tropical waters reach from isolated archipelagos to the southwest to the great continent of Mernat.

Sea of Ítikîr : high winds and sea-ice of this circumpolar sea make it the most dangerous of Kethiran waters.

Sea of Iváe : this sea is named after the large island of Ivae, home to the Ivinian people, renowned sailors and traders.

Shéntu Sea : the waters between Anzeloria and southeast Lythia are noted for monsoons and tropical storms.

Thiánic Ocean : this vast body of water touches all three continents, but its extremely dangerous tropical summer cyclones leave it little travelled by mariners.

Venârian Sea : an ancient people named the Jarind called these warm and sheltered waters the Emel Vadive , or 'Middle Sea'. The Venarian Sea serves as conduit between the economies and cultures of central Lythia and the powerful realms of northwest Venarive.
