## Pantheons

ÁLTIC

QUÂRPHIC

Kethira's central landmass of Lythia is home to hundreds of religions collected into over a score distinct pantheons. Those of continental Kamerand and Mernat, as well as the various religions of the many isolated peoples throughout the entire world, greatly increase the array. This book focuses on the pantheons and religions of Venarive , the populous northwest portion of Lythia.

A single pantheon consists of several religions. For instance, the West Venarian pantheon is comprised of ten, each devoted to a single god: Agrik, Halea, Ilvir, Larani, Morgath, Naveh, Peoni, Sarajin, Save-K'nor, and Siem.

Not shown are the many local pantheons of the various tribal

people. Also not depicted are areas that express a blend of

two or more pantheons.

Most folk recognise their culture's entire pantheon and often informally propitiate a handful of its gods. A humble farmer might offer several short prayers to various gods throughout the same day: to Peoni for abundance while in the fields, to Larani for protection while travelling, and to Morgath for appeasement upon hearing the death of a distant family member.

The map below shows the extent of thirteen major pantheons of Venarive. The Major Religions of Venârivè table on the following page lists each of their religions, including the associated divine aspects.

| Roúhtta  | Bringer of disease&death  | mor |
| Sýra     | Mother of All             | eon |

In addition to these six traditional gods, the worship of Sarajin of the Ivinian pantheon has become more prominent.

The Altic people also practice shamanism, especially among the more traditional Forest and Great Alt tribes.

| Navéh   | Lord of the night&death    | nav     |
| Tásha   | Mother of the hearth       | eon     |

The Besha nomads of the Beshakan Desert worship only a small subset of those deities recognised by other peoples. Aranik is dominant, while Naveh is venerated by small cults.

In common with many tribal cultures, the Bésha also practice shamanism.

| Sárajìn | Lord of the snows, storms &waters | kaj     |
| Úsnârl  | Bear of the North                 | ivo     |

Traditional Ivinians worship only Sarajin and his associates or demigods listed above. They consider almost all other gods to be unworthy of veneration, but this attitude is changing as their voyages bring them into greater contact with other pantheons, such as the West Venarian.

* Aspects vary greatly.

In addition to these major gods commonly worshipped across Anzeloria, there are many local gods and deities of considerable variability. There are few organised religions in the region, and even fewer priesthoods that extend beyond a given tribe or clan.

Many Anzelorians  also practice shamanism.

Dalken theology is polytheistic to a greater extent than is commonly the case in other parts of Venarive. Duality is an important concept in the pantheon. For example, the rival Churches of Aranik and Aranu recognise a strong theological link with each other.

| Sesáya | Spirit of music &hospitality | hal |
| Sýnaya | Spirit of the land           | eon |
| Umára  | Spirit of rivers &wells      | ara |

Similar to the Reksyni pantheon, the deities of the Ketari are viewed as 'spirits' rather than 'gods', their nature more abstract than even the most mystic of Western faiths.

The Ketari also practice shamanism.

While they characterise their two chief gods as 'spirits', the Quarph also practice shamanism.

With no specialised priesthood, the Reksyni give leaders a religious role and recognise notable others as prophets.

This also serves as the Karejian pantheon and is very similar to that of the West Venarian. The following smaller religions and 'cults' are recognised but not given official status:

The	Hacherim	only	recognise	two	vague	gods-Nalma	and Ovrash. They perceive other divine beings as servants of this duality, either angels (nalmarim) or devils (ovrarim).

While some of the Mafani gods are similar to those of western Venarive, others seem unique enough to appear as nearly distinct gods.

This west Venarian pantheon serves the major realms of the Hârnic	Isles,	Shorkyne,	Emelrene,	Palithane,	and	Trierzon. Many of the tribal peoples throughout the regions, especially on	Hârn,	practice	shamanism .

The Emhle tribal folk have a variegated system of worship called the Cult of the Covenant. Central to their pantheon are a group of nine Old Gods called the Kuelrhyn (page 343).
