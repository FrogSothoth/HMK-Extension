# Armour

## armour

In most cultures throughout Venarive, there are simply two categories of warriors-those with armour and those without it. Wealthy combatants wear the most and best they can afford. The rest seldom enter battle with more than their clothing and shield and perhaps a helmet.

## Armour Material

HârnMaster recognises nine different types of material:

Cloth : heavy, coarse buckram or serge for the masses, linen and silk for the wealthy; includes soft leather, an expensive status material in western Venarive that offers no greater protection than buckram.

Leather : heavy, stiff rawhide used primarily in belts and shoes in most of Venarive; in cattle-rich cultures of central Lythia, often fashioned into near-rigid tunics.

Padded : either a single layer of thick wool clothing, or wool or flax stuffed between two stitched layers of cloth. Padded may be worn over or under other armour, such as Mail, often integrated into its construction.

Quilted : usually six to eight layers of cloth sewn together, perhaps stuffed as with Padded. Quilted articles are worn by themselves or sometimes over other armours, but are too thick to be worn readily under Mail or Plate. Quilted also includes the thick furs of northern or tribal folk.

Gambeson : a substantial, near-rigid material of usually 16-24 layers of stitched cloth, neither cheap nor light. With articles worn almost exclusively by themselves, Gambeson offers meaningful protection but is very heavy when wet.

Kûrbúl : Azeryani word for several layers of leather treated with hot water into a hard but brittle material, used in helmets and breastplates, and for spot protection. About five times as thick as Plate, Kurbul offers but half the protection at an equal weight.

Scale : leather reinforced with overlapping metal plates. More cumbersome than Plate and less durable than Mail, Scale is quicker and cheaper to produce than both.

Mail : interlocking metal rings either secured by interlacing leather thongs or attached to an underlayer of Leather or Padded. While at least as cumbersome as Plate, Mail can be fashioned into various flexible articles that allow coverage of the entire body.

Plate : rigid and continuous metal covering, used for helms, breastplates, and spot protection. Plate articles are less encumbering over the same area than Mail, and even Gambeson, but remain fairly expensive.

## Armour Value

Armour provides protection by reducing the effective impact of strikes. Every attack delivers impact according to a specific aspect : blunt ( b ), edge ( e ), point ( p ) or fire/frost ( f ). The amount armour reduces in this way is called its armour value ( av ) and varies according to the armour's material and the strike's aspect. The total av of overlapping materials is simply the sum of their individual ratings in each aspect.

rigid armour ( indicated with an r after	the	AV	in	text )

Rigid Armour : an AV enclosed in a box-of any shadeindicates stiffer materials that reduce the lethality of edge and point Glancing Blows (step 3.2, page 168). This Rigid Armour quality applies to a location even when just a single layer among several possesses it. The grey and black fills refer to the Metal Armour Option (page 133).

Area Armour Value : see page 133 for an explanation of how to compute the Area AV in the fire/frost ( f ) aspect.

## armour reduction

Some weapons possess an Armour Reduction ( ar) trait that reduces a target's Armour Value against the point ( p ) aspect (down to a minimum av 0). Armour Reduction most commonly belongs to swung weapons, such as a pickaxe. The higher momentum of such weapons achieves better penetration than that of thrusted weapons, like a spear. Bodkin-tipped arrows and bolts have perhaps the most effective armour reduction. Note that even weapons with the AR trait are still subject to Glancing Blows (page 168).

| Morningstar • Estoc | 1 p               |
| Warhammerspike      | 2 p               |
| Pickaxe             | 3 p               |
| Bodkin projectile   | 4 p               |

Example : the impact of a warhammer's back-spike delivers point aspect strikes, but the nature of its design gives it a special ar 2 p . Against the spike, Padded &amp; Mail is reduced to av 6 r ( av 8 r -ar 2).
