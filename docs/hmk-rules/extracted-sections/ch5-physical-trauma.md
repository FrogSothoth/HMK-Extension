Recovery : resting 10 minutes reduces windedness	fatigue	by	5.	Characters	may benefit	from	one	10-minute	rest	every hour .

## weariness

| source         | period       | amount   | sr   |
|----------------|--------------|----------|------|
| Astral journey | Reembodiment | 0-20     | END  |
| Cold Exposure  | 4 hours      | 5-10     | •    |
| Heat Exposure  | 4 hours      | 5-10     | •    |
| Sleep Deprived | 24 hours     | 15       | END  |
| Summoning      | Per spell    | 5-20     | END  |
| Swimming, slow | 1 hour       | 5        | END  |
| Walking        | 4 hours      | 5        | END  |

Recovery : resting 4 hours reduces weariness fatigue	by	5.	Sleeping 8 hours reduces	it	by	15. Characters	may	benefit	from	one	4-hour	rest	and one	8-hour	sleep	every day .

## weakness

| source        | period       | amount    | sr   |
|---------------|--------------|-----------|------|
| Anaemia       | Per instance | 5perBP    | •    |
| Aural Shock   | Per instance | 5 per Lvl | •    |
| Disease       | Per instance | 5-10      | •    |
| Malnutrition  | Per instance | 5-10      | •    |
| Infection     | Per instance | 5-10      | •    |
| Poison        | Per instance | 5-10      | •    |
| Psyche Stress | Per instance | 5 perPSY  | •    |

Recovery :	weakness	fatigue	is	indefinite,	only abating as the character recovers from the given source	according	to	the	source's	improved	level. For	example,	fatigue	from	anaemia	is	reduced	by 5	for	each	Blood	Loss	Point	(BP)	reduced.

Fatigue Recovery Example : in the Trekking Fatigue example on page 149, Obris is ambushed after having accrued 10 weariness fatigue over a long day of hiking. He survives the attack but acquires 5 windedness fatigue during the struggle. Resting for 10 minutes afterwards removes the windedness. Having already benefited from a 4-hour rest at midday, his only option for the 10 weariness fatigue is sleeping through the night, which will then reduce it to 0.

## Physical Trauma

Characters might suffer fatigue, injury, and ailments while embarked on adventure. Although the GM can regulate the rate of exposure to such dangers, the rules reflect a milieu where PCs of all skill levels can never take lightly the consequences of suffering physical trauma.

## fatigue

The least dangerous trauma, fatigue can nonetheless hamper a character's performance. It can manifest as the windedness experienced after sprinting; the weariness resulting from hiking; or the weakness induced by longer-term conditions like anaemia. While these various sources differ according to accrual and reduction, they all impart the same global effect called fatigue, measured in quantities of 5, and applied as a penalty to tests unless a specific rule states otherwise.

## Fatigue Sources

The sidebar tables list the most common sources of fatigue, divided according to how the fatigue is felt and reduced-as windedness, weariness, or weakness. Each table includes the following information.

Period : how often fatigue is accrued.

Amount : how much fatigue accumulates per period.

Secondary Roll (SR) : whether an Endurance (END) SR accompanies each period. A successful SR reduces the amount accrued by 5. Such END SR are not themselves modified by fatigue penalty.

## personal fatigue (pf)

The windedness fatigue that characters gain from certain strenuous physical activity (see sidebar) can increase according to the burden of their gear and armour. Such accrual is measured by what is called Personal Fatigue (PF), equal to 5 plus their Encumbrance (ENC).

Stepped Accrual : for characters with high PF, the GM could implement accrual more frequently, applying 5 fatigue in subperiods. For example, those with PF 10 could accrue 5 halfway through the period and 5 at the end (when the END SR is made to reduce it). With PF 15, the periods are divided into thirds of 5 fatigue each; with PF 20, quartered, and so on.

## Fatigue Penalty

Fatigue applies as a trauma penalty to Success Tests and reduces Move.

Spirit : beings with a dormant soul who inhabit their body in the physical world do suffer fatigue penalty to Spirit tests. However, beings with an active soul in the spirit world do not.

Secondary Mastery : fatigue penalty does not apply to the attributes and skills used as a Secondary Modifier or in a Secondary Roll (page 62). Secondary Mastery is based purely upon ML Index.

## Fatigue Recovery

Once gained, fatigue has either a temporary or indefinite duration. Temporary fatigue automatically abates after the given periods described in the sidebar (windedness and weariness). Indefinite fatigue lessens only as its associated condition abates (weakness).

## injury

After a battle or encounter, characters who have sustained injuries must follow the Healing Sequence (sidebar) to determine their outcome. Some severe wounds that do not initially prove fatal might kill the character hours, days, or even weeks later. Others might heal only to leave the character impaired in some way. Central to these rules are the healer's Physician skill and the patient's Healing Base .

## Physician Skill

Characters test Physician skill to treat patients in a variety of instances. Only one healer may make a Physician test on a patient at a given moment, but up to two other assistants may help (page 60).

## treatment

The Healing Sequence details different treatments for each injury. To give the patient the best chance of recovery, healers are required to administer the treatment as specifically described.

Equipment : healers must have certain supplies to perform some treatments. See bandages and surgery tools (page 120).

Self-treatment : conscious patients can treat their own Minor and Serious Injuries and Bleeding, unless the GM thinks circumstances or a disability would make it implausible.

No Treatment : most injuries left untreated will still heal on their own, although much less effectively. Bleeding is a fatal exception.

## Healing Base

All characters have a Healing Base (HB) equal to the average of Endurance and Will, with fractions rounded up if END &gt; WIL. Patients test a multiple of HB when they make Healing Rolls (step 6). Patients also use their HB when overcoming ailments such as disease and poison, detailed in a later section.

Estimated Healing Days : refer to the sidebar table for an estimation of how long injuries take to heal. The results are derived from rolls in the Healing Sequence that would leave the patient fully and safely recovered. This should not replace the detailed process a PC faces to overcome wounds; however, the GM might use the table for NPCs or to give players a general idea of how long it will take for their characters.

## healing sequence

Take the following eight steps to treat an injured character. Each step is detailed in the highlighted Healing Sequence pages:

| [�] Bleeding...................................   | page ���   |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------|
| [�] Extended Shock.........................       | page ���   |
| [�] Coma.......................................   | page ���   |
| [�] Injury Type ...............................   | page ���   |
| [�] Treatment ................................    | page ���   |
| [�] Healing ...................................   | page ���   |
| [�] Infection ..................................  | page ���   |
| [�] Impairment..............................      | page ���   |

Kèthîran Healing : however harsh the injury treatment rules seem, they still reflect the more advanced healing practices found on Kèthîra as compared with medieval Terra, especially in terms of stopping blood loss and preventing infection. Patients likely have the shared lore of Elder Folk to thank for this greater efficacy.

The Healing Sequence addresses purely mundane techniques. Refer to the Herblore skill entry for exotic potions that grant bonuses to many of the tests; esoteric healing includes the Healing talent, Fyvrian spells, and elixirs .

## estimated healing days

The table below estimates how many days an injury of the given Severity (M, S, G) will take to have its Injury Level reduced by 1 using the Healing Sequence. This varies by the healer's Physician ML ( phy ) and the patient's Healing Base ( hb ). The results exclude the chances of Infection and Impairment (pages 181-182).

Example : an S3 injury treated with Physician ML71 for a patient with HB14 usually takes 7 days to heal to an S2, a further 7 days to heal from an S2 to an M1, and 5 days to heal completely (19 days total) .
