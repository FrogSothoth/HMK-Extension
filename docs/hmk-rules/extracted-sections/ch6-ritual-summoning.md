# Ritual Summoning

## Ritual Summoning

Legends often mention shadowy gates to dark places, through which fell, otherworldly monsters come.

While Pvarism is the most common arcane tradition on Kethira, it is not the only one. The three widely outlawed religions of Agrik, Naveh, and Morgath teach their more learned priests the arcane skill of Summoning.

## summoning skill

Summoning is an Esoterica Group skill with an Aura and Eloquence skill base. Each religion's version is its own, separate skill, available only to clergy of a certain minimum Circle: Gytevsha Summoning (Naveh IV); Shadow Summoning (Morgath III); and V'hir Summoning (Agrik IV).

While summoning is arcane spellcasting, it does not use the Form-Principle model of Pvarism. Instead of bodily channelling Principle energy, a summoner taps Gateway forces to send a request to a specific ethereal entity. Such a call demands precise articulation on the caster's part. The slightest confusion or gaff wrecks the spell and can expose the summoner to the cosmic horror.

If properly formulated, the request is then arcanely sent to the spirit world. Such transmission is akin to telepathy and manifests by way of 'mental' Barasi Points. For Navehan and Agrikan missives, the target entity is a demonic spirit who still might yet resist. With Morgathian castings, the entreaty for the Shadow goes through an intercessor, such as Klyss the Necromancer, who then allows or denies its release.

Ritual summoning is not a demand but rather an accord. The summoned agrees to come or is given to the summoner-there is no coercion. As the specific spell descriptions attest, even such agreement is tenuous and not proof against the summoner suffering grave trauma.

## Summoning

In Pvaric spellcasting, the mage creates a Form and then fills it with Principle, the channelled ethereal energy that triggers the spell effect. The model for Summoning is different. Here, summoners carefully formulate their request and then harness Gateway forces to transmit the message to the desired entity in the astralscape, who still might deny the summons.

Priests follow four steps to attempt ritual summoning.

[�] Religious Event : the priest must lead and complete a specific ceremony of the associated religion, as explained in the spell entries (page 347). When the ceremony ends, the priest tests

Ritual skill on the Ritual Devotion Roll table (page 319) to determine the priest's Piety expenditure. A failed test here (CF or F) ends the Summoning routine.

[�] Summoning Roll : after the ceremony and a successful Ritual Devotion Roll, the priest begins the summoning spell, testing Summoning skill at the end of casting Time.

Trauma : all types of fatigue affect the summoner's test. Anything that breaks concentration (page 182) prevents it altogether (all other impairment has no effect).

[�] Fatigue : the lengthy ceremony, casting time, and taxing formulation of summoning exact weariness fatigue (page 176) rather than the windedness of Pvaric magic.

[�] Effect : the effect of a successful summoning varies by the spell. Sometimes the summoned entity receives an opposed Spirit test to deny an otherwise successful Summoning Roll. A priest may repeat a failed summoning, but the requisite ceremony only occurs once per month on a specific day.

Summoning Index : the entries on the next page use the same SI abbreviation as found in the Pvaric spell entrieshere, for the specific Summoning skill Spell Index.

## gytévsha summoning

The caster summons a single demonic servant of Naveh at the end of Dezenaka , the monthly high ceremony. At spellstart, the priest selects a Devout Shade or one of the three types of Lesser or Greater Gytevshai (pages 396-397).

With successful spellfire, the outcome is determined by opposing the caster's Summoning test with a Spirit test made by the chosen demon (break ties):

3 The	demon	is	summoned	and	controlled	by the	caster	for	triple	duration.

The results are in addition to those of the Summoning Roll table on page 346.

A summoned Navehan demon does not incarnate a shape in the physical world. The spirit instead appears in the astral locale that corresponds to the summoner's location. As a 1-turn action, the summoner may attempt Spirit Communing (page 295) with the demon, which begins with Unpopular Estrangement. When successful, the priest can command it to take Spirit actions (page 294), such as Roaming to and Sensing other astral locales, and Roaming back to the summoner to 'report' through another Communing. Such interaction lasts for duration or until the demon is dissolved.

If the summoner has perceived another character's True Form, then a successful Spirit Communing can command the demon to assault the target. The priest telepathically shares the target's True Form during the successful Communing command; the demon then takes Spirit actions to roam to and assail the victim with its demonic powers.

Without having perceived the victim's True Form, the summoner must be in the physical location that corresponds to the target soul's astral locale. The priest can then use the Spirit Communing test to command the demon to Sense on its own the True Form and assault the target.

Time:

10 minutes

Duration:

SI rounds (or dissolution)

## shadow summoning

The caster summons the Shadow at the end of The Degrees of Nyardath , the Morgathian high ceremony. The amount of Shadow Strength (SHA) summoned depends upon the Nyardath group to which the priest belongs:

| nyârdathgroup   | circle   |   sha |
|-----------------|----------|-------|
| Shádath         | III      |     1 |
| Húldath         | IV       |     2 |
| Ámaldath        | V        |     3 |
| Vâredath        | VI       |     4 |
| Ûrkandath       | VII      |     5 |

A CS Summoning Roll doubles the SHA amount. At spellfire the caster distributes the summoned SHA in any combination among the following three target types.

Dalmôrvrin : each point of SHA applied to a Dalmorvrus within SI × 5 feet and LOS extends its thresholds of decomposition by the base amount (page 69). The SHA only affects those with up to Partial decomposition. Each point of SHA is 'used up' once applied-it does not increase the Dalmorvrin's SHA 0 score, but simply delays its decomposition.

Object : each point of SHA applied to an object within SI × 5 feet and LOS causes it to exude the Shadow of Bukrai for SI days. This has the usual effect against anyone nearby, including the summoner (page 377). Morgathians favour stone altars and sarcophagi, but they may target any object that weighs at least one pound.

Self : each point of SHA summoners apply to themselves automatically transforms into one Shadow Stress Level, but there is no Shadow Resistance roll. The priest enters Shadow Recovery, which can lead to Facing the Shadow (page 378).

During recovery from the Shadow so inflicted by the summoning, the priest gains the Shadow Control power. This grants command of Dalmorvrin.

Summoners who are themselves Amorvrin instead increase their own SHA by the amount of SHA applied. This summoned SHA has a duration of SI days, during which time the Amorvrus gains the Shadow Control power.

## v'hîr summoning

The caster summons one or more V'hiri, the demonic servants of Agrik. The casting takes place at the end of the High Ceremonies of the Balefire Disciplines . At spellstart, the priest specifies the type of V'hir summoned, from among the 2nd to 8th orders (page 399).

Casters may summon a number of demons whose sum total of their Spirit Indexes does not exceed the mage's Summoning Index. For instance, a caster with Summoning Index  7 could summon up to three 8th order V'hiri (Spirit Index  2 each). The same casting may not summon V'hir of different orders.

With successful spellfire, oppose the Summoning test with the demon's Spirit test (break ties). When summoning multiple V'hiri, one Spirit test of theirs applies to the entire group:

3 The	demon	is	summoned	and	controlled	by the	caster.	Duration	is	Index × 5	minutes.

The results are in addition to those of the Summoning Roll table on page 346.

Summoned V'hir incarnate in the physical world for duration or until dissolved. They first appear within Index × 10 feet and LOS of the summoner. As a 1-turn action, the summoner may test Command (Surikal) to issue instructions to it or to the entire group:

-  The command must be made verbally in Surikal , the Agrikan temple tongue.
-  The summoner must be audible and within SI × 30 feet of the demons.
-  V'hir offer an Unpopular Estrangement (-10 penalty to Command tests).
-  A Command CF lowers Estrangement to Hostile (-20 penalty). A Command CF while Hostile makes the V'hir attack the summoner-control is lost for duration.
-  A Command CS raises Estrangement by one level, to a maximum of Accepted.

Time:

10 minutes

Duration:

Varies or until dissolved
