# Advice & Options

## advice &amp; options: skills (1 of 2)

This section gives advice about skills and tests, including several options to expand their application.

## expanded skills list

The	standard	list	of	skills	in	HârnMaster	is	not	exhaustive.	Players can	add	others	according	to	specific	environments	and	cultures,	or simply	to	satisfy	the	gaming	group's	taste.	Doing	so	might	require adjustments	to	certain	rules.	Here	are	some	examples:

Armourcraft (DEX	·	STR)	SM0:	Armourcraft	is	distinguished	from Weaponcraft	as	its	own	Craft	group	skill.	Crafting	rules	are	the	same.

Distance Running (END	·	WIL)	SM3:	a	Physical	group	skill	whose Index	halved	is	the	period	in	hours	of	double	time	fatigue	accrual.

Skiing (END	·	AGL)	SM1:	a	Physical	group	skill	measuring	crosscountry	skiing.	Downhill	skiing	is	a	sub-skill	(AGL	·	STR).	Add	Skiing	to all Background Skills tables	for	certain	regions	(Ivinia,	Altor).

Sprinting (AGL	·	STR)	SM3:	a	Physical	group	skill	whose	ML	plus Move	equals	the	double	Move,	'sprinting'	rate	(but	only	if	the	result	is higher	than	simply	double	Move).

Storytelling (ELO	·	CRE)	SM2:	a	Social	group	skill	that	measures	the ability	to	spin	tales.	Folklore	might	serve	as	a	Secondary	Modifier.

## expertise

The	productive	output	of	skills	is	broad	by	design-basic	game	play does	not	reflect	special	focus.	However,	consider	allowing	welltrained characters to develop just such Optional Expertise in	a	skill. See also Required Expertise (right),	where	certain	skills,	such	as Melee,	could	very	well	demand	such	focus	as	the	rule.

## optional expertise

Most	skills	provide	natural	opportunity	for	special	focus.	Here	are	a few	skills	with	their	possible	expertises:

| skill       | expertise                                 | skill                  | expertise                                  |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Animalcraft | Birds Dogs Horses Livestock               | Folklore (cont.)       | Mythic Beasts Poetics Society              |
| Archery     | Compositebows Crossbows Longbows          | Legerdemain            | Juggling Purse Cutting Sleight ofhand Axes |
| Charm       | Courtly grace Inspiration Seduction       | Melee                  | Clubs Flails Knives                        |
| Engineering | Fortifications Houses Mills Siege weapons |                        | Polearms Shields Swords Unarmed            |
| Fletching   | Arrows &bolts Bows Crossbows              | Mercantilism Theatrics | (see skill entry) Acting Mimicry           |
| Folklore    | Geography History Kelestia                | Weaponcraft            | Disguise Armour Weapons                    |

Gaming groups can decide for themselves whether to expand the list of	expertises.	However,	some	skills	by	definition	are	already	quite focused	and	should	probably	not	benefit	from	further	division,	such as	Initiative	and	Slings;	or	already	function	similarly	to	expertises, such	as	Musician,	Shipwright,	and	Pvarism	(Convocations).

During	character	generation,	when	a	character	develops	a	skill beyond SM5 ,	an	expertise	may	be	selected.	From	this	point	on,	each Development	Point	(DP)	spent	on	the	skill	may	be	assigned	to	the expertise,	granting	it two Mastery Boosts .	However,	when	doing	so,	the general	skill	itself	receives	no	Mastery	Boost	from	the	assigned	DP .

- An	expertise	has	a	maximum	Mastery	Level	equal	to	SB×7,	the	same as	the	general	skill	itself.
- Characters	may	select	multiple	expertises	in	the	same	skill.	A	given DP	grants	the	two	Mastery	Boosts	to	only	the	selected	expertise.
- After	developing	an	expertise,	the	character	may	revert	to	assigning DP	to	the	general	skill,	but	only	the	general	skill	improves	by	the one	Mastery	Boost-the	expertise	does	not.
- Modifiers	that	affect	the	general	skill	affect	expertises	equally.

Example 1 :	at	the	end	of	step	6	of	character	generation	(Optional	Skills), the	young	knight	Obris	has	had	Melee	developed	to	SM5	for	ML70.	During step	8	(Sunsign	Development),	1	DP	is	assigned	to	Melee	and	the	player selects	Swords	expertise.	This	raises	Melee	(Swords)	to	ML80	(ML70 + 5 + 5), leaving	Melee	in	all	other	weapons	at	ML70.

Example 2 :	at	the	end	of	step	6	of	character	generation	(Optional	Skills), the	old	scholar	Elben	has	had	Folklore	developed	to	SM5	for	ML75.	During step	7	(Veteran	Development),	the	player		assigns	1	DP	to	Folklore	and decides	to	select	the	History	expertise.	This	raises	Folklore	(History)	to	ML84 (ML75 + 5 + 4),	leaving	general	Folklore	at	ML75.

As an old character Elben receives another round of Veteran Development	and	1	DP	is	again	assigned	to	Folklore	(History)	as	an expertise,	raising	it	to	ML92	(ML84 + 4 + 4),	but	again	leaving	general Folklore	at	ML75.	In	step	8	(Sunsign	Development),	the	player	assigns	1 DP	to	general	Folklore,	raising	it	to	ML80	(ML75 + 5).	Folklore	(History) remains	at	ML92.

As	a	follower	of	Save-K'nor	with	Ritual	ML30,	Elben	starts	the	game with	a	low	blessing	bonus	of	+4	to	Folklore	tests.	This	raises	the	general Folklore	EML	to	84,	and	the	History	expertise	EML	to	96.

See Chapter 8: Campaign for	how	to	develop	expertises	after character	generation	(page	414	sidebar).

## required expertise

Gaming	groups	may	prefer	to require skill	expertise,	rather	than	to make	it	merely	optional.	Thus,	once	the	general	skill	reaches	SM5	(or, optionally,	even	a lower SM,	such	as	SM4),	all	further	development must	be	through	the	separate	expertises.	Each	DP	spent	past	this	SM threshold	raises	one	expertise	by	only one Mastery	Boost,	not	by	two as	in	the	above	Optional	Expertise	method.

Required Melee &amp; Archery Expertise : the previous HârnMaster Gold edition splintered weapon development into over a dozen separate skills.	Gamers	preferring	something	akin	to	this	can	incorporate required	Melee	and	Archery	expertises	that	begin after	SM4 in the general	skill,	not	SM5.	In	the	case	of Melee skill,	each	DP	spent	beyond SM4	raises	the	SM	by	1	in any two separate Melee weapon groups (not	just	one).	Starting	Dodge	ML	is	then	derived	from	the	Melee expertise	that	ends	with	the	highest	SM.

Example : the PC Roderick has Melee SM4 and SB16, for ML64. The player spends 1 DP on Melee, selecting Shields and Swords expertises, both of which go	to	SM5	(ML80).	One	final	DP	is	spent	on	Melee,	and	this	time	the	player selects	Unarmed	(SM5;	ML80)	and	Swords	(SM5+1;	ML84).	Dodge	receives the	SM5+1	from	Swords	(SB14;	ML75).	The	other	five	weapon	groups-Axes, Clubs, Flails, Knives, and Polearms-all have ML64.

## faeriecraft

When	making	weapons	and	armour	(pages	88-89),	an	Ælrhin	crafter makes	a Spirit Secondary Roll in	the	Success	Value	test	of	step	3.	A successful	SR	improves	the	item	through	an	intangible,	astral	quality. Faeriecraft	is	not	itself	magic	(and	cannot	be	dispelled),	although affected	items	might	also	include	actual	enchantments.

Hartbow :	successful	faeriecraft	halves	the	Draw	characteristic	of composite	and	longbows	(page	108).

Longknife :	a	faeriecrafted	Vagorsereq	has	the	+5	Melee	weapon	trait (page	98),	which	applies	to	strikes,	blocks,	and	thrown	attacks.

Metal armour :	faeriecraft	reduces	the	ENC	of	an	article	of	metal armour	by	five	and	halves	its	weight	in	pounds	(page	118).	Ælrhin usually	craft	mail,	but	faeriecraft	extends	to	scale	and	plate	articles.

Faeriecraft	also	applies	to	any	craft	skill	that	produces	singular items,	such	as	Jewelcraft,	Textilecraft,	Woodworking,	and	certain applications	of	Masonry	(sculpture).	The	effect	increases	Success Value	by	one.	An	SV	above	9	results	in	an	'otherworldly'	six-star	item.

## senses

Beings	inhabiting	their	bodies	in	the	physical	world	have	senses that	vary	according	to	their	physiology.	For	Folk,	they	usually	include eyesight,	hearing,	smell/taste,	and	thermoception	(touch).	The	sense of	balance	is	measured	by	Agility	(AGL).

The	unified	Perception	(PER)	attribute	does	not	mean	that	the various	senses	are	not	differentiated	in	the	world,	but,	rather,	that each	individual	sense	has	the	same	game	score	as	the	others.	For expediency,	a	character	with	PER13	has	an	effective	13	in	the	three core	physical	senses:	EYE13,	HRG13,	SML13	(and	TCH	is	reflected	in the	DEX	score).	The	previous	HârnMaster	Gold	edition	generated separate	scores	for	these,	and	gaming	groups	are	encouraged	to	do	so similarly	if	they	wish	(page	57).

Perception Test : whether	players	use	unified	(PER)	or	separate scores	(EYE/HRG/SML),	the	associated Attribute tests represent the active use of the given sense-a character concentrates on using it to interpret	the	designated	target	phenomenon.	Suspicious	guards	test PER	(eyesight)	to	examine	the	copse	of	trees	where	they	believe	the enemy	to	be	(perhaps	they	shield	their	eyes	from	the	sun's	glare	as they	peer	across	the	field).	Hunters	test	PER	(hearing)	to	identify	the screeching	noise	echoing	across	the	valley	(perhaps	they	cock	their heads	slightly	to	better	focus	on	the	strange	sound).

Awareness Test :	by	contrast,	an Awareness skill test represents a reactionary,	passive	use	of	the	given	sense-training	greatly	affects being	alert	to	sudden	phenomena,	especially	when	engaged	in another	activity	or	when	distracted.	In	these	instances,	characters must	test	Awareness	skill.	A	lax	guard	tests	Awareness	(eyesight)	to notice	a	brigand	moving	among	the	trees.	Characters	have	the	option to use Awareness instead of the Perception attribute when testing active uses of the senses (above) if their Awareness ML is higher (the result	of	exceptional	training).

Both	types	of	tests-Perception	(active)	and	Awareness	(passive)are unopposed tests when	the	targets	themselves	are	not	actively trying	to	avoid	being	perceived.	Thus,	if	the	brigand	is	simply	hiking through	the	trees,	then	the	guard	makes	an	unopposed	Perception (active)	or	Awareness	(passive)	test	to	notice.	However,	if	the	brigand actively	uses	Stealth	to	sneak	through	the	trees,	then	the	situation is	resolved	by	an opposed test of	the	brigand's	Stealth	skill	versus	the guard's	Perception	or	Awareness	(see	the	Stealth	entry,	page	84).

## success value tests

Success	Value	tests	most	often	measure	repeated,	long-term	skill	use. Consider	these	four	model	applications	offered	in	the	rules:

Standard :	several	skills	in	Chapter	3	refer	to	the	standard	SV	table	on page	61.	Here,	GMs	are	left	to	establish	the	meaning	of	the	SV	as	they see	fit,	such	as	interpreting	the	depth	and	breadth	of	knowledge	from a	Folklore	SV	test.	However,	many	of	these	skill	results-like	those involving a craft	(Glassworking,	Woodworking)-should	very	likely follow	the	Masterwork	style	(below),	but,	for	lack	of	space,	have	not been	enumerated	in	this	way.

Standard Star :	many	skill	rules	assign	a	specific	quality	to	each	star resulting	from	SV5-9,	such	as	Dancing	and	Musician	(+5	bonus	per star	to	persuasion	tests).	Similar	per-star	applications	are	found throughout	the	rules	(Intrigue,	page	140;	Survival,	page	145).

Spectrum :	the	results	of	some	SV	tests	measure	a	rate,	distance, or	span	of	time,	and	do	not	lend	any	special	meaning	to	the stars . Instead,	the	SV	itself	measures	a	unique	spectrum,	such	as	how	far a	character	climbs	(page	67)	or	swims	in	a	minute	(page	86).	Success Value	tests	can	even	be	used	to	measure	the	results	of	brief,	single actions,	such	as	jumping	distances	(page	77).

Masterwork :	several	SV	tests	involve	an	extra	step	of	resolution, wherein	the	1	to	5	stars	generated	from	SV5-9	equal	the	number of	separate	d10	rolls	made-these	are	called	Masterwork	Rolls,	the term	used	in	the	Weaponcraft	skill	entry	(page	88).	These	one	to	five d10	rolls	are	made	against	a	Target	Number	(TN)	from	a	different source,	such	as	the	Workshop	TN	in	crafting	(below).	The	TN	can also	be	derived	from	the	Index	of	an	attribute	or	other	skill,	or	even something	completely	unique,	such	as	the	water	Conditions	in	a Fishing	SV	test	(page	71).	It	is	the	number	of	successes	on	these	d10 rolls	that	determines	the	ultimate	quality	of	the	test.

## workshop target number

Crafting	tasks	usually	require	access	to	a workshop keyed	to	the	skill tested	(page	121).	The	state	of	the	workshop	is	rated	on	a	1	to	5	star Quality	scale	(right).	To	see	whether	the	crafting	test	produces	a special	item-a	masterwork	item-a	number	of	d10	equal	to	the stars	generated	by	the	SV	test	are	rolled	against	a	TN	equal	to	the workshop's	star	Quality	(TN1-TN5).

Each d10 success is called a Masterwork	Success	(MWS)	and	can result	in	special	modifiers-see	the table	in	step	5	of	Making	Weapons	in	the Weaponcraft	skill	entry	for	an	example (page	88).	In	addition	to	modifying an	item's	characteristics,	the	MWS

| quality   | state     |
|-----------|-----------|
|          | makeshift |
|         | sparse    |
|        | standard  |
|       | plentiful |
|      | ideal     |

multiplies its value by	×2	to	×6,	as	shown	in	the	same	step	5	table..

Tool Quality (TQ):	the	above	workshop	Quality	reflects extensiveness . However,	the	tools	themselves	can	have	an	independent	Quality	that measures higher effectiveness .	Such	TQ	ranges	from	0	(standard)	to +3	(highest	quality)	and	serves	as	a	modifier	to	the	TN	established	by the	workshop	in	the	d10	Masterwork	success	rolls.	Thus,	+1	tools	in	a standard	workshop	(three	stars)	result	in	TN 4	for	the	d10	rolls.

- The	applicable	TN	bonus	from	tools	cannot	exceed	the	workshop's own	star	rating.	Thus,	+3	tools	used	in	a	sparse	workshop	(two	stars) only	provide	a	+2	bonus-for	an	adjusted	d10	TN 4	(not	TN 5).
- TQ	beyond	0	increase	the	cost	of	the	workshop	itself	(page	121)	by ×2	(+1	TQ),	×4	(+2	TQ),	or	×6	(+3	TQ).
