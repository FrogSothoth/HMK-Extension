## nolóra: melee example (1 of 2)

The	Emhle	hunter	Nolora	has	been	tracking	two	outlaws	from	Neoma for	the	past	few	days.	Sensing	her	pursuit,	Galmos	and	Faldrik	set	up an	ambush	on	a	mountain	ridge	as	she	approaches.

Environment :	Nolora	finds	herself	in	a	thick	forest	of	evergreens in	early	spring.	There	has	been	no	precipitation	for	weeks,	and	the ground	has	mostly	dried	after	the	recent	snowmelt.	A	midafternoon sun	drops	in	the	western	sky,	now	partially	obscured	by	the	canopy	of trees.	She	hikes	carefully	uphill	with	her	bow	readied,	about	75	feet from	the	crest	of	the	mountain	ridge.

Note :	the	players	describe	the	battle	narratively	without	the	use	of miniatures.	Distances	are	given	in	feet	rather	than	spaces.

## round 1

The	two	outlaws	hide	behind	trees	at	the	crest.	This	calls	for	an opposed	test	between	Nolora's Awareness and	the	outlaws' Stealth skills	to	determine	if	she	notices	them	peeking	out	to	spy	her.

| Nolora   | Awareness 75   | Roll 26   | → S   |
|----------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| Galmos   | Stealth 40     | Roll 48   | → F   |
| Faldrik  | Stealth 40     | Roll 54   | → F   |

Nolora	spots	both	of	them,	foiling	the	surprise.	The	GM	decides no	one	needs	to	test	Initiative	as	a	Reaction	Roll,	since	all	expected trouble-everyone	is	aware.	The	Initiative	Rank	order	is:

- IR75 Nolora

- IR60 Faldrik

75	feet	from	Nolora

- IR50 Galmos 100 feet from Nolora

ir75 nolora :	Nolora	has	her	war	bow	nocked	with	a	heavy broadhead	arrow.	She	decides	to	ready	a	1-turn	Shoot	action	in	hopes of	getting	a	clearer	view	of	the	outlaws	(Readied	Actions,	page	161).

ir60 faldrik :	Faldrik	unsheathes	his	falchion	as	a	free	action	and then	selects	the	1-turn	Move	action	to	run	50	feet	towards	Nolora, arriving	25	feet	from	her.

Nolora	takes	her	readied	Shoot	action	at	Faldrik	after	his	full	Move (this	moves	her	to	IR59,	just	after	Faldrik).	She	looses	the	heavyshafted	broadhead	arrow	from	25	feet,	well	within	point-blank	range (+10	bonus).	The	running	Faldrik	is	considered	a	moving	target	(-10 penalty).	Nolora's	shot	uses	a	d6	Zone	Die.	The	player	announces	an aim	for	ZN1,	and	tests	her	Archery	skill:

Nolora

Archery	75

Roll	56 → S Strike

The d6 ZD and d10 LD are rolled:

d6	ZD

Roll	1

→ Head

d10	LD

Roll	3 → Skull

A	heavy	arrow	has	d12	impact	die;	Nolora's	DRW125	bow	adds	4;	and the	PB	range	adds	2	for	d12 + 6 p impact:

d12+6 p

Roll	9 → 15 p

Faldrik	wears	a	quilted	coat	suit	with	a	kurbul	helm	that	grants	rigid AV 4	against	P-aspect	skull	strikes:

Strike	Impact	15 p - AV4 = Effective	Impact	11 p

<!-- image -->

s3 This	results	in	an injury	to	the	skull.	To	see	if	the	broadhead arrow	induces	a	bleeder,	increase	effective	impact	by	5	(page	108):

Effective	Impact	11

Bleeder	5 → 16 p

This	'virtual'	impact	16	generates	a	G4	injury.	However,	the	table	in step	3.3	(page	168)	says	the	white	circle	( )	of	the	skull	location	is	not	a bleeder	until	the	G5	level.	Thus,	the	'G4'	injury	is	not	a	bleeder. Faldrik	makes	a	Shock	Roll,	a	test	of	Shock	ML60:

Faldrik

Shock	60

Roll	58 → S SHK 0

The	injury	inflicts	a	total	SHK 8	(Skull 5 + S3 + 0),	leaving	Faldrik incapacitated (INC) and fallen to the ground about 25 feet from Nolora.	He	suffers 10 impairment to	the	Head	zone.	The	Serious	injury penalises	all	Impaired	tests	and	movement,	and	induces	a	Morale Roll	(once	no	longer	suffering	a	Shock	State).

Seeing	his	only	ally	vanquished,	Galmos	must	make	a	Morale	Roll against	Initiative	ML50.	Rolling	a	36,	he	remains	steady	and	fights	on.

ir50 galmos :		with	light	bodkin	arrows	stuck	readily	in	the	ground, Galmos	may	load	his	bow	as	a	free	action	and	then	shoot	Nolora	as	a 1-turn	action	with	his	DRW75	bow	from	100	feet.	Just	outside	the	90foot	point-blank	range,	Nolora	is	a	still	target.	He	aims	for	ZN1:

Galmos

Archery	40

Roll	39 → S Strike

Galmos	receives	a	Precision	TA	since	Nolora	is	still.	He	uses	a	d8	ZD, and	two	are	rolled.	The	same	d10	LD	applies	to	both	ZD	rolls:

two	d8 	ZD

Roll	5,	8

→

Torso

or

Leg

d10	LD

Roll	3

→ Thorax

Thigh

The	GM	chooses	the	thorax.	A	light	bodkin	does	d8	and	the	draw-75 bow adds 2:

d8 + 2 p

Roll	7

→ 9 p

Nolora	wears	a	quilted	surcoat	over	heavy	clothing.	This	gives	AV2 against p -aspect	strikes	to	the	thorax,	but	the	bodkin's	AR 4	cancels	it.

Strike	Impact	9 p

-AV0 = Effective	Impact	9

p

The	arrow	imparts	an injury	to	the	thorax	but	is	not	impaled (page	170).	Nolora	makes	a	Shock	Roll,	a	test	of	Shock	ML65: s2

Nolora

Shock	65

Roll	83 → F SHK 1

The	injury	inflicts	SHK 7	(Thorax 4 + S2 + 1),	leaving	Nolora	stunned (STN).	She	also	suffers	10	impairment	to	her	torso	zone,	affecting most	actions	and	movement	(page	170),	but	faces	no	injury	mishap.

Nolora's	player	decides	to	make	a Fate Roll (page	276)	to	improve the	Shock	Roll.	The	Fate	Roll	ML	equals	50	-	5	(from	her	Aura	ML45 Secondary	Modifier)	+	5	(Combat	Group	Sunsign	modifier):

Nolora

Fate	Roll	50

Roll	27 → S +1	SL · 1	FP

The	Fate	roll	succeeds,	costing	one	Fate	Point.	This	increases	her previous	Shock	Roll	from	a	Failure	to	a	Success,	thus	reducing	the SHK 7	to	SHK 6.	With	this	result,	Nolora	is	not	stunned,	but	she	still suffers	the	10	impairment	to	the	Torso	zone	from	the	S2	injury.

The	GM	requires	PCs	to	make	Morale	Rolls	when	triggered,	and Serious	injury	is	a	trigger.	Since	Nolora	is	not	stunned,	her	player immediately	rolls	12	against	Initiative	ML63-she	remains	steady.

## round 2

ir60 faldrik :	Faldrik	begins	his	turn	incapacitated	and	so	takes	no action.	At	the	end	of	his	turn,	he	makes	a Shock Reroll test	with	a	-20 penalty	(step	4,	page	169):

Faldrik

Shock	60 - 20

Roll	34

→

S

Success

This	immediately	improves	his	Shock	State	to stunned (STN),	lasting at	least	until	the	end	of	his	next	turn.

ir59 nolora :	Nolora	begins	the	turn	with	her	bow	unloaded.	She	has one	arrow	loosely	attached	to	her	belt-the	GM	allows	a	successful DEX	or	Archery	test	to	enable	her	to	reload	it	as	a	free	action.	Against Archery	EML67	(Archery	77 - 10	impairment	),	a	roll	of	52	succeeds.

Then,	as	a	1-turn	action,	she	selects	the	Shoot	action	at	Galmos, a	still	target	partially	covered	by	a	tree	100	feet	away.	The	GM	rules that	the	tree	gives	him	protection	in	zones	6,	8,	and	0.	Within	her point	blank	range	(+10	bonus),	but	impaired	by	her	torso	injury	(-10 penalty),	she	uses	a	d6	ZD		and	aims	for	ZN1:

```
Nolora Archery	75 + 10 - 10 Roll	75 → CS Strike
```

A	CS	strike	versus	a	still	target	includes	a	Precision	TA	and	a	bonus TA.	Nolora's	player	selects	Impact	(+4	strike	impact	for	her	P-aspect broadhead	arrow).	Two	d6	are	rolled	and	the	player	selects	one	of	the results.	The	same	d10	LD	applies	to	both	ZD	rolls:

```
two	d6	ZD Roll	6,	6 → Torso or Torso d10	LD Roll	3 → Thorax Thorax
```

Since	both	ZD	results	are	zone	6,	a	second	d10	LD	is	rolled	from	the Precision	TA:	a	4	is	a	Thorax	strike!	Fate	Rolls	are	not	allowed	with zone	dice,	so	her	shot	plunges	into	the	tree	next	to	Galmos'	chest.

ir50 galmos :	Galmos	loads	another	light	bodkin	from	nearby	in	the ground	as	a	free	action,	and	then	takes	the	Shoot	action	at	Nolora. From	100	feet	away,	his	shot	EML	is	the	same	as	last	round:

Galmos

Archery	40

Roll	69

→

F

Miss

The GM decides there is no chance for an errant shot hitting the intervening	Faldrik	since	he	remains	on	the	ground.

## round 3

ir60 faldrik :	Faldrik	begins	his	turn	stunned,	deciding	to	crawl	off the	trail.	Being	stunned	and	prone	are	both	Difficult	Movement,	so his	full	Effective	Move	40-already	reduced	by	10	from	the	head injury-is	halved	twice	to	10	feet.	He	is	near	cover,	but	still	exposed. At	the	end	of	his	turn,	he	makes	a Shock test	(step	4,	page	169):

Faldrik

Shock	60

Roll	71

→

F

Failure

Failing,	he	remains stunned (STN)	through	the	end	of	his	next	turn.

ir59 nolora : with the torso impairment reducing her Effective Move	from	55	to	45,	Nolora	now	has	half	Move	20.	She	draws	her broadsword	as	a	free	action	(gripping	the	bow	in	her	left	hand), selects	the	1-turn	Charge	action,	moves	20	feet,	and	engages	and threatens	Faldrik	within	the	sword's	5-foot	Engagement	Zone.

## nolóra: melee example (2 of 2)

<!-- image -->

Faldrik	is	prone,	and	still	stunned,	but	uses	his	falchion	to	block	her strike	with	a	prone	-20	penalty,	and	a	default	aim	at	her	ZN2	(since she	is	standing).	Using	her	sword's	d6	ZD,	Nolora	aims	at	ZN4	(but with	no	-10	penalty	since	Faldrik	is	prone).	They	each	test	Melee:

```
Nolora Melee	71 Roll	09 → S Strike Faldrik Melee	60 - 20 Roll	87 → F Stunned State -1	SL = CF Mishap
```

The opposed test results in a two-star victory for Nolora (S vs CF); and a Stumble mishap for	Faldrik.	His	test	roll	was	an	87	(F),	worsened	by	one Success	Level	to	a	CF	from	being	stunned.	Odd-numbered	ones	dice are	stumbles,	but,	since	he	is	already	prone,	this	is	ignored.

Nolora	selects	Impact	for	the	Tactical	Advantage	(+5	strike	impact for	E-aspect	weapon).	Her	broadsword's	d6	ZD	and	d10	LD	are	rolled:

```
d6 	ZD Roll	2 → Torso	(Aim	ZN4	and	roll	of	2	equals	ZN5) d10	LD Roll	3 → Thorax
```

Her	broadsword	does	d10 + 3 p impact; her STR adds 1; and the Impact TA	adds	5	for	a	total	d10 + 9 e impact:

d10+9 e Roll	6 → 15 e Faldrik's	quilted	coat	has	an	AV4	against e -aspect	thorax	strikes Strike	Impact	15 e -AV4 = Effective	Impact	11 e This	inflicts	an injury.	Faldrik	makes	a	Shock	Roll: Faldrik Shock	60 Roll	44 → S SHK 0 s3

The	injury	inflicts	SHK 7	(Thorax 4 + S3 + 0),	stunned.	Since	he was	already	stunned,	the	new	stunned	state	worsens	Faldrik	to incapacitated (INC),	as	explained	in	the	Shock	section	of	the	table	on page	169.	He	also	suffers 10 impairment to	the	thorax	(Body	zone), which combines with the 10 impairment from	the	skull	injury	in	Action tests	(page	170),	and	reduces	his	Move	from	50	to	30.

The	thorax	location	includes	a	grey	circle	(page	167);	so	step	3.3 of		the	Injury	Sequence	says	the	S3	injury	is	not	a	bleeder.	Lastly, the	S3	injury	calls	for	an	Injury	Mishap	check	( ),	but	the	Torso (thorax)	location	does	not	induce	one.	Since	Faldrik	has	just	become Incapacitated,	he	remains	prone,	unaware,	and	unable	to	act,	making a	Shock	Reroll	at	the	end	of	his	next	turn.	He	owes	two	Morale	Rolls, one	from	each	Serious	injury,	but	at	this	rate	they	might	not	matter.

ir50 galmos :	Seeing	Faldrik	vanquished-again!-Galmos	must	test morale.	A	roll	of	64	against	Initiative	ML50	is	a	failure,	so	he	withdraws over	the	mountain	crest.

## round 4

ir60 faldrik :	Unable	to	act	(INC),	Faldrik	makes	a Shock Reroll with a -20	penalty	at	the	end	of	his	turn:

```
Faldrik Shock	60 - 20 Roll	82 → F Extended	Shock
```

Faldrik	suffers	Extended	Shock	HR5,	which	is,	in	effect,	indefinite incapacitation	for	several	hours	(page	179).

ir59 nolora : Nolora considers pursuing Galmos but instead begins to	bind	Faldrik,	who,	while	conscious,	is	unable	to	take	action.	She then	begins	treating	the	arrow	wound	to	her	chest.
