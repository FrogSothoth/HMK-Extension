# Animals

## Animals

The largest number of beasts on Kethira are the myriad forms of animals, both domesticated and wild. They populate all continents and thrive in most climates.

## Domesticated Animals

Societies raise creatures for food and work but also as pets. Below is a sample of such domesticated animals found throughout northwest Venarive. See the Animalcraft skill for how to train them beyond the base MLs given here.

## bovine

A wide range of herding animals, such as cattle, bison, and buffalo. Folk train them to pull ploughs and wagons (for instance, oxen) or use them for dairy products and meat.

## camel

Work animals native to Hepekeria, capable of great endurance (but lower REA and CRE by 2 when training). The mounted combat RCH penalties go to -2 (page 172).

## cat

Small pets and pest-controllers. Cats come in a variety of sizes and colours; folk often associate them with esoterica.

## dog

Trained canines come in many varieties for many uses, three of which are highlighted here.

Ratter : small, tenacious dogs trained for pest control, able to crawl through tight spaces ( terrier ).

Hunter : medium-sized dogs used in tracking and hunting ( greyhound , wolfhound , bloodhound ).

Guard : large breeds used as attack dogs ( mastiff , molossus ).

## horse

The various members of the horse family are greatly prized throughout almost all cultures of Venarive.

Donkey : small, stubborn descendants of wild asses; they lower their handler's Control TN by 1.

Pony : a small horse of one of many different breeds; several cultures train them as swift and sure war mounts.

Mule : the offspring of a donkey and horse; they have a bonus -20 ENC modifier but lower Control TN by 1.

Palfrey : a medium-sized horse used as a riding, cart, or plough horse. The latter two, also called draught horses, have Move 110 rather than the riding palfrey's listed 130.

Courser : a swift medium-sized horse often trained for the hunt or as a light warhorse.

Charger : the standard horse bred and trained for war.

Destrier : a large ferocious horse bred for battle and to bear the weight of a plate-and-mail-clad warrior.

## ram

A male sheep or goat. The latter have STR 14 (-1 to AV and impact); females reduce STR by 4 (-2 to AV and impact).

## animal special abilities

Clench : after a successful bite, the creature can make an opposed d6 + STR roll. If successful, the bite remains clenched. Clenched bite strikes receive +20 bonus, and successes always hit the clenched location. The animal has +2 STR bonus to resist rolls to break the clench.

Constrict : the snake usually drops from above and makes a Bite (clench) attack. With the next strike or counterstrike, it coils with a Grab (Hold) attack-a TA with which means it also pins the target's arms.

Constricted targets make a Shock Roll against SHK 6 (torso) or SHK 7 (head) on the snake's turn if the grab has been maintained. If rendered UNC, targets die from cardiac arrest on their next failed Shock Roll. Coiled targets whose arms are not pinned may attempt Grab (Break) attacks to escape.

Dive : increase impact by 5 on a successful Talon strike that accompanies a flying Charge action.

Gore : increase impact by 4 on a successful Tusk strike that accompanies a Charge action.

Rider Impact bonus : bonus to rider melee impact from movement listed in parenthesis after move (page 355).

Poison : virulence and course vary by species from HR4 (10 hr) to HR3 (10 min) to HR2 (1 min); see page 186.

Tram ple : the creature can make a Kick attack against a prone target it moves over. One trample can be made during a Charge, Move, or Barge. The low aim trait does not apply, and such a trample is not considered an action (a second trample could be the Charge's attack).

## mount stumble rolls

Failed mount stumbles inflict d10 + 0 b strike impact to a random location (Stumble CF +5 impact). Leg injury treatments have the Healing Rate (HR) reduced by 1 (M), 2 (S), or 3 (G). Adjusted HR2 or less means the mount's leg will not mundanely heal on its own.

Riders thrown from a mount suffer a fall of d10 - 2 b impact to one location (d10 ZD), plus 5 at a full or double Move-resolve using the Falling Routine as usual (page 67 sidebar). Deliberately dismounting from a mount going faster than a half Move is a leap .

## training animals

The ML for animals reflect base domestication (page 122). They can be trained further and controlled with the Animalcraft skill (page 65). The rules for mounted combat are in Chapter 5: Adventure (page 172).

## Wild Animals

## fox

The group of small- to medium-sized dog-like omnivores found everywhere on Kethira except the polar regions. In Venarive, foxes are associated with cunning and trickery.

Any of the myriad medium-sized birds of prey trained for hunting small wild game such as rabbits or other birds. They require constant attention or risk becoming feral and uncontrollable. See Flying (page 353).

## lion Mountain Cat Catamount

The Lythian lion ranges from the mountains of Ivinia to the Azeryani wilderness. While a carnivore, its predation at dawn and dusk does not usually extend to humans. If cornered, the cat emits a harsh scream and attacks in a frenzy of biting and raking claws- each round it may attack with a second Action TA (if the chance arises).

## snake

Poisonous : usually found active in warm weather in the north, or in the tropics, poisonous snakes rarely attack unless startled or threatened. The deadliest variety inhabit the subtropical and tropical regions. A bite Melee d100 roll with an odd units die is a 'dry bite'-no venom is discharged (but this chance can vary greatly by species).

Constrictor : usually inhabiting the tropics, some constrictors are found in southern Trierzon and the forests of Azeryan (known as island constrictors ). Constrictors might confuse as food folk who are near their natural prey (such as rodents), or who simply carry the prey's scent. These huge snakes Clench first with a bite and then Constrict (page 354 box).

## stag Deer Antelope

This is any of a number of horned herbivores valued for their hide and meat, found all over the world. The male ( stag ) sometimes charges when protecting young.

## wolf

This carnivore preys on deer, cattle, and small mammals, roaming in packs of up to two dozen. They howl before or after hunting and, most dangerously, are believed to follow the commands of the legendary wargs (page 391).

a

The variety of wild animals throughout Kethira is vastbelow is a selection common to northwest Venarive. While wild animals, even predators, rarely attack folk, there are certain situations that might provoke them: when protecting their young, during mating season, or in reaction to prodding or training by people. hawk/falcon

## bear

Bears inhabit the temperate and subarctic wilderness in almost all regions. They are generally placid, unless threatened or directly irritated.

Grey ( Black Bear ): one of the many smaller bears, the grey bear of the Jerinalian Mountains eats primarily fish but can be aggressive to humans if hungry.

Lýthian : these brown-furred bears are much larger and more aggressive than the grey and black bears. The Lythian lets out a great roar right before charging a perceived threat, often briefly rearing up on its hind legs.

Kyáni : these massive cream-coloured bears inhabit the polar and subarctic regions. Their sense of smell might be unrivalled by any other mammal on Kethira.

## boar

Often hunted ceremonially because of their association with warriors, the wild boar populates regions from the cold temperate in the north to the warmer climates around the Venarian sea. Males can be quite aggressive during the winter breeding season, known for charging gore attacks to a person's lower body (ZN6-7 aim with no penalty).

## crow Raven

The name is used for dozens of species, this crow is one of the larger variety, the raven, known for its wiliness. Esotericists often revere them. See Flying (page 353).

## eagle

The name is used for several large birds of prey found throughout Kethira. As apex bird-predators, they use their keen sense of sight to hunt with their hooked beaks and strong talons. Prey varies by habitat, and includes fish, snakes, and small mammals. See Flying (page 353).

## elephant

In Venarive, the League of Serianapi uses elephants as archery platforms (page 122 sidebar). The burden equals 1000 lb (harness, platform, drover and three archers and their gear), but only a final ENC10 (125 ENC offset by a -115 STR modifier). As targets, such occupants are protected by the platform wall in the Legs, with Zone Reach penalties of 7 (Head/Arms) and 6 (Torso). A drover, when alone, straddles its back, similar to riding a horse, with target Zone Reach penalties of 5 (Head/Arms) and 4 (Torso/Legs).

Thinner Hide : AV is lower for the Ear ( 4b · 4e · 3p · 4f ) and the underside of the Thorax and Abdomen ( 12b · 11e · 9p · 11f ).

## pouncing attacks

Creatures employ a wide range of techniques to knock prey down: lions spring, bears hug, dogs lunge. Such pouncing attacks can be modelled with them taking a Charge Press attack that knocks the target down, followed by their getting In Close with a Barge. In subsequent rounds, the creature strikes and counterstrikes by biting (clenching) and clawing.
