# Divine Grace

## Divine Grace

For reasons known only to them, the Lesser Gods sometimes establish a special relationship with living folk, a connection the faithful call a state of grace . Utterly incomprehensible, grace is not a skill mortals can develop but is rather a god's gift bestowed on one deemed worthy.

A character may receive the state of grace in two ways.

Birth : the divine might award grace to characters when they are born. During character generation (page 40), players roll a d20 to determine whether grace points are granted to their character and how many. If the character is simply Marked for Grace, or actually receives 1-2 Grace, the player selects one of the twelve aspects (page 310) to be associated with its bestowal. While the aspect might reflect their persona-a trait, skill, faith, or occupationcharacters with grace need not be priests or religious at all. Even an aspect diametric to their nature is possible.

Deeds : the divine also select people for a state of grace according to their actions in the world. Characters who are followers of a religion, itself associated with a specific aspect, often have such feats clearly defined for them according to the faith's traditions. The GM can treat other undertakings, even ones made by the non-religious, similarly. In all cases, the chance to receive grace through deeds requires completing an Ordeal (page 318).

## miracles

Characters who achieve a state of grace are able to request miracles. Whereas arcanists can dictate their magic to work overtly and strangely, characters with grace cannot control how miracles unfold -they merely make the request. It is the Aspects (the Lesser Gods) who decide whether and how the miracle manifests. When they answer a call and do intervene in the world, their resulting miracles usually present as natural events or good luck.

For example, escaping from a collapsed cave by melding through tons of rock requires Fyvrian magic; finding egress through a fortuitously discovered hidden passage could be a miracle. Conjuring ethereal fire into your palm is a Peleahn spell; sparking a fire with the first strike of flint on a storm-drenched ship could be a miracle.

The Gods also usually refrain from producing miracles that are technically mundane but still rare and amazing. While tidal waves, earthquakes, and meteor showers are all natural events, the few Kethirans who have experienced them would view them as quite extraordinary and enigmatic, perhaps even attributing their sudden, catastrophic appearance to the working of powerful magic.

However, there are exceptions that can challenge some of these very restrictions. While characters with grace still cannot dictate their precise effect, such uncanny miracles can manifest inexplicably, some even quite strangely.

## Miracle Request

Characters with at least one Grace may ask for a miracle.

[�] Test : requesting a miracle does not involve a test.

[�] Action : there is no required cant or gesture. The entreating character need not be conscious but must be alive. Only the intent of the miracle is described; requesters have no control over the specific way the miracle plays out in the world. The GM determines if the request is granted in light of the Concordat's restrictions (page 348) and the following guidelines:

-  A miracle is denied if the request starkly contradicts the Aspect associated with the character's Grace, as defined by its seven descriptors (page 310).
- A miracle to save the life of the requester (and allies) is granted; a miracle to smite suddenly another creature is denied-although deaths might indirectly result from the miracle (see The Virtuous example, page 312).
- A miracle manifests only in the present encounter or near-term situation, and only if it directly involves the requester. There is some leeway here, with miracles perhaps manifesting a few days after the request (see The Lucky example, page 312).
- A miracle disrupts the physical environment as little as possible, even if otherwise natural. The rare uncanny miracle (below) can be an exception.

[�] Time : the request takes no time (not even a free action).

[�] Result : if the request is granted, reduce the character's remaining Grace by 1; the GM then weaves the miracle's result into the game narrative. A miracle request is not an opportunity for the GM to trick players or twist their wording. The miracle is either granted, its intention honoured; or denied, but rephraseable until accepted.

## tracking grace

Players record two Grace numbers: the total amount ever received; and the remaining left to spend on miracles. For example, a character starts with 2 Grace, spends 2 on miracles (leaving 0), but then earns 2 from an Ordeal, raising the total amount to 4 with 2 remaining.

Characters with Grace from more than one Aspect track amounts separately. The Concordat's Principle of Selfinterest (page 348) might prevent some miracle requests by those with multiple Grace from conflicting gods.

## uncanny miracles

Each time a miracle is granted, the GM rolls a d20-if the result is less than or equal to the requester's remaining Grace (before reducing it for the current miracle), the Aspect might produce an uncanny miracle instead of a mundane one. The GM decides if it actually happens, and just how strangely. For tips, see The Virtuous example on the next page and Advice &amp; Options on page 349.

## the lucky

Sarbo	is	a	mercantyler	from	the	great	city of	Tashal	on	the	isle	of	Hârn.	Intelligent	and alert,	Sarbo	is	not	particularly	martial	or athletic,	but	the	player	decides	to	make	him adventurous,	willing	to	take	unconventional risks	to	acquire	wealth	and	power.	During character generation it is determined that Sarbo	possesses	two	Grace	points.

Grace :	the	player	decides	to	roleplay	the grace	as	completely	unconscious	to	the character.	While	perhaps	vaguely	believing in	the	gods	of	the	West	Venarian	pantheon, Sarbo	does	not	possess	Ritual	skill	in	any of	its	ten	religions.	Given	Sarbo's	shrewd materialistic	bent,	the	player	links	his grace	to	the	HAL	aspect,	considering	its domain ( wealth ) and mode ( luck ) as partial explanations	for	the	character's	persona. Throughout	his	life	many	have	considered Sarbo	extraordinarily	fortunate-he	sees this as resulting from thoughtful planning rather	than	from	some	unseen	force.	During the	early	part	of	the	campaign,	Sarbo's player	spent	1	point	of	Grace,	leaving	him with	1	out	of	the	total	of	2.

Miracle :	Sarbo	is	currently	part	of	a	group travelling the wilderness Fur Road into the rugged	northern	lands	of	Orbaal.	Halfway to	their	destination,	Lorkin-a	coastal	town where	they	hope	to	find	timely	passage to	a	keep	on	the	outer	islands-a	terrific thunderstorm	waylays	their	progress.

Worried	about	reaching	the	keep	in	time to	complete	a	lucrative	trade	with	its	lord, Sarbo	realises	they	will	need	to	book	a	vessel quickly	in	Lorkin	for	the	ensuing	voyage. Sarbo's	player	announces	that	this	'wishful thinking'	will	actually	be	an	unconscious request	for	a	miracle.

The characters continue their march through	the	wilderness	to	Lorkin.	The	GM rolls	a	4	on	the	d20	against	Sarbo's	one remaining	Grace-a	mundane	miracle. Upon	arriving,	Sarbo	meets	within hours	an	old	friend,	a	retired	Orbaalese viking	piloting	a	small	Nivik	sailing	ship, now	anchored	in	port.	As	it	turns	outluckily-the	pilot	owes	Sarbo	a	huge favour	from	years	ago	and	is	more	than happy	to	transport	his	group	to	the	island immediately.

## the immaculate

Jayda	is	a	native	of	Iwil,	a	Numec	subnation in	the	northwest	region	of	Hepekeria.	Born into	the	Zawan	(bard)	caste,	Jayda	travels the	deserts	of	her	people,	bringing	news	and sharing	tales.

Grace :	during	character	generation	Jayda's player	rolled	to	see	whether	the	character starts with grace-an 18 produced 1 Grace point.	Since	she	also	has	skill	in	Aseq	Ritual ( solitary wanderer ),	the	player	links	her grace	to	ZER,	the	god	Aseq's	likely	aspect. Its element ( mind ) and domain ( knowledge ) nicely	reflect	Jayda's	bard	occupation.

Miracle :	in	the	middle	of	one	adventure, Jayda	and	the	other	PCs	find	themselves captured	by	a	group	of	bandits	deep	in	the desert.	With	the	PCs	facing	sure	execution, Jayda's	player	describes	a	plan	for	escape that	involves	her	attempt	to	influence	the bandits with a glorious tale about their people's	past.	She	also	decides	that	this	is	a crucial	moment	in	the	campaign	for	Jayda to	request	a	miracle.	It	is	especially	suitable since	the	scheme	involves	skills	very	much in line with the ZER aspect-mind and knowledge.

Jayda's	player	roleplays	the	storytelling and tests its impact with an Eloquence (Folklore)	Success	Value	test.	She	describes the	intent	of	Jayda's	miracle	request:	' please help me and my allies safely escape from the bandits ' .	The	GM	deems	this	an	appropriate request	and	rolls	d20	against	Jayda's	1 point of Grace-a 14 means the miracle will manifest	naturally	(nothing	'uncanny').

While	Jayda's	storytelling	is	effective in	its	own	right,	the	GM	expands	its influence	to	include	several	fortuitous-but mundane-elements: the guards watching over the other imprisoned PCs are drawn away	by	the	revelry	engendered	by	Jayda's inspiring	tale,	allowing	her	friends	to	break free	of	their	poorly	secured	shackles…

## the virtuous

Sir	Toneld	hails	from	Shorkyne	in	northern Venarive	but	is	presently	a	freelance	knight in	the	Palithaner	army	besieging	the	city	of Waleden.	In	service	to	the	River	Army	to	the east	of	that	conflict,	Sir	Toneld's	mercenary band	has	been	involved	in	many	skirmishes against	the	attacking	Trierzi	feudal	muster near	Hevel	manor.

Grace : no PC in the group received Grace during	character	generation.	However, Sir	Toneld's	player	selected	for	him	skill	in Larani	Ritual,	a	reflection	of	the	character's pious	chivalrous	outlook	and	combative occupation.	During	the	ensuing	campaign, Sir Toneld completed a Substantial Ordeal (travelling from his homeland far to the north to the besieged Waleden) and received	2	Grace	for	doing	so.	The	player links	them	to	the	ARA	aspect-associated with Larani-and envisions Sir Toneld as a	holy	warrior	who	acts	in	the	name	of	the Lady	of	Paladins.

Miracle :	with	Sir	Toneld's	group	cornered	in a	dire	melee	with	a	dozen	Trierzi	enemies, his	player	describes	a	miracle	request	to	save the	knight	and	his	three	fellow	mercenaries, a	quite	logical	association	with	ARA.	The request	is	accepted,	reducing	the	remaining Grace	to	1.	The	GM's	d20	roll	against	the	2 total Grace is 2-the miracle is uncanny .	The GM decides that the Trierzi warriors must begin	to	make	Morale	Rolls	at	the	start	of each turn until Withdrawing or Routed (with Rally	Rolls	automatically	failing)-this	is	the mundane	part	of	the	miracle.	Additionally, a	halo	of	crimson-streaked	light	seems to follow Sir Toneld as he vanquishes the enemy	with	a	heroic	display	of	virtuous battlelust.	His	resounding	cry	of	' Ambrathas !' permeates	the	field,	silencing	the	ringing	of steel	and	the	death	rattle	of	fallen	enemies.
