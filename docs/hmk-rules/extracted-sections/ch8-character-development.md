## Character Development

After character generation, Development Points (DP) no longer improve skill ML. Instead, progression is tracked through Skill Development Rolls or Experience Points (or a combination of the two). A character's Standing only rarely fluctuates, given the rigidness of class mobility in most Kethiran societies. However, everyone suffers the eventual effects of Ageing .

## Skill Development Rolls

Every in-world month, characters receive three Skill Development Rolls (SDR) to attempt skill improvement on any of their skills selected by the player (even

two or three on the same skill). For each SDR, the player rolls d100 and adds the chosen skill's Skill Base (SB). If the sum exceeds the current ML, the ML increases by 1. Otherwise, there is no effect (the SDR fails).

Gamemasters may also award a bonus SDR to a character's skill when it is tested at a significant moment or used in a noteworthy situation (as deemed by the GM). Such an SDR is made the moment it is awarded, allowing for additional ones at some point later in the session. GMs can instead postpone SDR until the end of the session, perhaps limiting any given skill to just one SDR per session, no matter how many significant uses of it occurred. See the next page for more advice on using SDR.

## Experience Points

A separate approach to character development gives each character 10 Experience Points (XP) at the end of every gaming session. The player then selects any skill and increases the ML by 1 by spending XP equal to its current Index (minimum 1 XP). Any one skill is limited to +1 ML from any single award of 10 XP. For example, raising an ML59 to ML60 costs 5 XP; raising an ML40 to ML41 costs 4 XP; and raising an ML08 to ML09 costs 1 XP . These three +1 ML increases expend, in total, 10 XP . The XP method usually replaces SDR entirely, but GMs may consider combining them.

Players can save XP for use with a later award. Perhaps a player wishes to improve two ML60 skills-one skill could increase by 1 ML for 6 XP, with the remaining 4 XP saved. Then, 2 XP from the next 10 XP allotment could be combined with the saved 4 XP to raise the second skill by 1 ML, leaving 8 XP . Experience Points can also be awarded in greater quantities (30 XP or 50 XP) but over a longer period of timeperhaps at the end of an adventure or every in-world season.

During character generation, the 5 DP awarded at each Age Group (Optional, mature Veteran, old Veteran) broadly equate to a rate of 10 XP per in-world year . While such a slow rate is likely not desirable by most groups once the game starts, the GM can use this as a benchmark to monitor skill improvement over a long campaign. For instance, if the GM expects to play a 50-session campaign over the next two real-world years (about two sessions per month), then it might be announced at the start that 10 XP will be awarded at the end of every logical narrative arc, but no more than 40 XP per in-world year. This still leaves the PCs progressing at four times the rate during character generation.

## untrained skills

Skills at SM0 usually may not be tested-these are called untrained skills. Characters might be able to improve them to SM1 during the campaign through the following procedure.

Training Period : the base full-time training period is three months (10 hours per day, 24 days per month). Double this period to six months for part-time training, from either half the daily hours or half the monthly days.

As adults, usually only nobles have the time to undertake actual full-time training (or pursue part-time training in two separate skills at the same time). Guilded and free characters, with other vocational commitments, most likely can only pursue part-time training in one skill (and only if the GM finds even this plausible). The poor and unfree generally can train part-time only when the skill is highly associated with their current milieu ( a farm labourer training Animalcraft from SM0 ).

Training requires proper resources and equipment, which vary greatly by skill. Major inadequacies simply prevent training. While training, characters receive no monthly SDR.

Instruction : the training period assumes instruction by a teacher with ML60 in the associated skill and Discourse ML20. To gauge exceptional instruction, the teacher makes a Success Value test of the associated skill. For each star result, roll a d10 against a TN equal to the teacher's Discourse Index. Each success reduces the final training period by 10%.

Languages : if the language being learned is from the same language family as the character's native language, increase SM by one after the training period. If the character is immersed fully in a location speaking the foreign language, increase SM by one (by two if both conditions are met).

Esoterica : Arcane Talents cannot be 'learned' from SM0, unless the GM devises special esoteric circumstances ( an experience triggers it ). For all other Esoterica Group skills, training periods are quantified in years , not months. Esoteric ability is hard-earned on Kethira, and best attained in youth. GMs may, as usual, choose to lessen such a harsh rate.

## mastery level maximum

The highest attainable ML in a given skill equals the character's Skill Base (SB) × 7. No more development may take place beyond it.

SDR : once ML reaches 100  +  SB for a skill with SB17 or higher, only a natural SDR roll of 100 improves the skill, by one ML. When the skill ML reaches SB × 7, development is no longer possible, as above.

There is an enjoyable, intuitive game element to SDR: test a skill now, try to improve it later. However, consider these features when solely using SDR for ML improvement:

-  SDR can be unfair to players -some PCs succeed while others fail. Over the long term, such variableness can even out, but gaming groups will have to decide how much of this inconsistency is acceptable.
-  Bonus SDR can lead to ML progressing too rapidly, especially when coupled with the three monthly rolls. Skills that take a PC years to improve during character generation can jump similarly in mere months-or days!-in-world. GMs must monitor even XP awards in this regard, of course.
-  The GM should strongly consider offering bonus SDR for skills that were not literally tested, but that their character very likely used significantly in the world in a noteworthy situation. Thus, a PC who tended and drove 20 mules during an arduous 10day trek could very likely deserve an SDR in the Animalcraft skill-even if the game play of the journey was 'hand waived' by the GM to expedite the campaign. This approach goes a long way in better simulating how the PCs live in the world than how the game often highlights a narrower range of tested skills.

## development options

Expertise Option (page 92): if using this rule, each +1 ML resulting from SDR or XP may instead be applied as +2 ML to one expertise, selected just like during character generation. When using the Required Expertise rule, each +1 ML resulting from SDR or XP must be dedicated separately as +1 ML to an expertise.

Subskill Option : once the game begins, the Shock and Dodge subskills are developed as their own separate skills. Optionally, the same allocation of XP could apply to both the main skill and its subskill. For example, the same 7 XP applied to Melee ML70 and Dodge ML60 improve both by 1 ML, with Dodge retaining 1 unused XP for future XP development

## attribute scores

The game assumes that characters work to maintain Attributes at their rolled, peak score. Thus, 'Attribute increases' are not needed, nor even realistic in many cases. What is plausible in real life ('I hike to improve END') is better viewed in the game as either already happening ('I hike to maintain my given END'), or suitable as a new skill (Condition ML replaces END to measure cardiovascular fatigue accrual).

## Standing

While standing within the unfree, free, and noble classes might fluctuate, social mobility between them rarely arises. The feudal unfree who reach a freetown or mining settlement and evade capture for a year and day become free; and free soldiers could receive knighthood from feats of arms-but even penniless gentry retain their noble status. Thus, only special circumstances change a character's broad social class.

Income : characters are usually employed in their occupation for 24 of each month's 30 days, which provides the clothing, food, and shelter associated with their Wealth score (page 52). Each month, characters also earn ten silver pennies (d) times the sum of a number of Wealth Dice rolls equal to the Star rating of the core associated skill ML. For instance, a clothier with Textilecraft ML72 (three stars) earns 3d3 × 10d.

Expenses : characters not working receive no such income and, in fact, must pay a daily living expense in the lodging column of the Standing table (page 52) associated with their lifestyle. Those on expedition trade this expense for the literal cost of gear and rations (page 120).

## Ageing

In games comprising of just a handful of sessions, characters likely do not face the effects of ageing. However, for campaigns that span more than one in-world year, apply the following steps every year, starting in tr 721, on 1 Nuzyæl, the first day of the year. Select a more suitable date if needed, preferably one during a sizeable stretch of downtime.

[�] Ageing Roll : for mature characters (starting at the age of 30), make a separate d10 roll against TN9 for each of the six Physical Attributes. For old characters (starting at the age of 50), make a separate d10 roll against TN9 for all twelve Attributes, both Physical and Mental.

[�] Reduction : if the d10 roll fails, reduce the corresponding Attribute score by 1. Update its Attribute ML and any characteristic affected by the change, such as ENC and strike impact modifier from STR loss.

Each Attribute may be reduced only two times during the mature age group years and three times during the old age group years. Ignore subsequent losses until the next age group. An Attribute reduced to 0 does not necessarily imply death.

[�] Skill Base : refigure all Skill Bases (SB) that are affected by an Attribute reduction. Remember the special rounding rule (page 45).

[�] Mastery Level : when ageing reduces SB by one, lower the skill's ML by an amount equal to ML divided by the previous SB (drop fractions). For each one SB reduction, the minimum ML loss is 1 and the maximum ML loss is 5.

Elder Folk : Ælrhin never suffer the effects of ageing. Kuzhai make the above dice rolls, but only once every five years, starting in tr 725. Ænarin (half-elves), Malakta, and Nadi age as for humans, except old half-elves roll for ageing only every other year ( tr 722+).
