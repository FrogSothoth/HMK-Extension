bris takes one last look at the valley behind him. On this clear spring morning, he can still see the main hall and outbuildings of Belveron, the manor his father manages as bailiff for Duke Anavras at Neoma. The rich meadowlands that stretch out from it along the banks of the Legama river have provided ample livelihood to generations of herders. Today he spots a handful of the largest flocks of sheep meandering about during their early grazing.

He turns to catch up with the two people his father charged him with escorting-Elban, an affable scholar from far-off Hârn, and Nolora, a taciturn guide and member of the tribal Emhle from the surrounding mountains. They have come to interview Maken, the elderly herder who said he lost sheep to a marauding beast. He claims to have witnessed it flying off with a ewe, or at least a large part of its remains.

Obris reaches them at the familiar hill crest lined with the crumbling low wall of a ruined watchtower. 'I say!' Elban exclaims, his interest piqued by a small rock cairn piled next to the wall. Just as Obris begins to share the story behind the ancient ruins, he stops suddenly, noticing Nolora further up standing motionless on a small boulder, with a hand thrust in the air to halt them.

She seems to peer into the forest ahead, but is actually listening, intently. To the sudden silence. Obris instinctively grabs the pommel of his sword and a nerve twitches at the back of his neck. With dread, he's compelled to turn around. Across the expansive and quiet valley, near Mount Himlenkul miles away, he swears he can make out wings.
