elestia is the cosmic all -everything that exists, the sum total of all realities within and beyond space and time. The most profound traditions developed by the various peoples of Kethira to understand Kelestia are collectively called the Mysteries. Scholars often distinguish between three branches: the Arcane, the Astral, and the Divine.

The Arcane Mysteries attempt to draw directly from the primal forces of Kelestia. Its practitioners train themselves to interact closely with these energies, and their personal skill greatly shapes how they manifest them in the physical world. This is what most call magic.

The Astral Mysteries also require skill to explore. However, the journey takes students into the unseen spirit world. While their training affects the success of reaching such an ethereal place, astralists gain power only through beseeching, once there, great spirit entities. If successful, they return able to express subtle esoteric power in the physical world.

The Divine Mysteries involve neither the active control of magic nor the petitioning of mighty spirits. Instead, their power results from supra-normal entities (gods) acting in the world through a chosen mortal, whose connection to any resulting blessing or miracle is unfathomable.
