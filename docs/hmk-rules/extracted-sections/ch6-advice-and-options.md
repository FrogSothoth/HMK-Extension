# Advice & Options

## advice &amp; options: the mysteries (1 of 2)

This	section	gives	advice	and	options	on	the	Mysteries,	most	importantly	explanation	of	the	Concordat	Principles	and	how	they	inform	miracles.

## concordat principles

The Concordat of the Illimitable Tome sets out the divine rules governing	the	Lesser	Gods.	What	follows	is	a	brief	summary	of	its	core principles (see the publication On Divinity for	more	details).

Duress :	gods	cannot	force	mortals	to	become	devout.

Ineluctability :	mortals	cannot	comprehend	divine	purpose.

Least Action :	miracles	are	usually	expressed	in	the	mortal	world	with the	least	amount	of	mundane	impact.

Natural Force :	miracles	almost	always	must	be	explained	by	the mundane	actions	of	folk	or	by	natural	phenomena.

Preservation :	gods	do	not	initiate	action	directly	or	by	proxy	that might	destroy	Kelestia	(reality).

Privacy : gods do not provide for their devout unlimited access to the secrets	of	their	enemies.

Proxy :	gods	do	not	act	directly	against	one	another.

Purity of Soul :	gods	do	not	modify	the	personalities	of	mortals	in order	to	make	them	devout.

Reaction :	for	each	miracle	that	works	against	the	interests	of	a	god, there	may	be	an	equal	and	opposite	one	to	balance	it.

Response :	except	in	special	circumstances,	miracles	happen	only when	requested	by	the	devout.

Revelation :	gods	do	not	reveal	cosmic	knowledge	to	mortals.

Self-interest :	gods	do	not	have	to	act	against	their	own	interests.

Temporality :	gods	can	never	modify	the	past.

Transpotence :	gods	are	not	omnipotent,	but	they	do	have	power beyond	mortal	folk's	understanding.

Unwitnessed Transgression : if a god transgresses unobserved against	the	Concordat,	then	no	transgression	has	occurred.

Veil of Faith :	the	faith	of	mortals	is	founded	on	the	gods	not	directly appearing	or	clearly	demonstrating	their	existence.

## miracle requests

Of	all	the	Concordat	Principles,	the	following	five	raise	the	most common	strictures	to	granting	or	manifesting	miracle	requests.

Least Action reduces the mundane impact of a miracle as much as possible.	This	principle	is	why	rare,	dramatic,	but	otherwise	natural events,	such	as	a	sudden	meteor	shower,	are	usually	avoided.

Natural Force prevents	bizarre	phenomena	but	not	extraordinarily coincidental events-as long as the miracle is plausible in the near term.	A	miracle	to	meet	the	king	would	be	answered	if	the	requester were	in	the	same	town	but	likely	not	if	hundreds	of	miles	away.

Privacy denies	the	secrets	of	the	requester's	'enemies'.	This	principle also	prevents	miraculous	mind	reading,	whether	the	subject	is	an adversary	or	notWhat is the mage thinking or Is the guard lying ?

Revelation does	not	allow	mortals	access	to	'cosmic	knowledge'	such as Who were the Earthmasters ?	This	also	prevents	sudden	insight, however mundane the informationWho killed the guildmaster ?

Veil of Faith keeps	the	gods	from	directly	revealing	themselves.	This does	not	extend	to	entities	summoned	in	their	name.	The	V'hiri	are quite	real,	but	their	appearance	does	not	prove	Agrik's	existence.

## consonance options

Consonance	(page	209)	governs	how	strongly	a	character's	Aura bonds	with	objects,	an	effect	similar	to	the	more	active	Attunement. A	rule	that	refers	to	'half	Spirit	ML	pounds'	of	gear/objects	implies such	Consonance	even	when	the	term	itself	is	not	mentioned.

Consonance	is	involved	mostly	in	Gateway	transferral,	various arcane	spell	and	elixir	effects,	and	artefact	creation.	For	characters whose	bodies	transfer,	dematerialise,	or	are	greatly	altered	(like from	the	Meld	spell),	objects	that	exceed	their	Consonance	weight limit	are	simply	left	where	the	body	had	been,	subject	to	gravity	(a rejected	worn	plate	helm	would	fall	to	the	ground,	for	instance).

Consider	these	optional	modifications	to	the	Consonance	rule:

- Increase	the	weight	limit	formula	from	half	to	full	Spirit	ML.
- Allow	the	affected	character	volition	over	which	objects	are affected,	especially	under	absurd	circumstances.	For	example, characters	may	discount	an	unwanted	bucket	thrown	over	their heads right before stepping through a Godstone-its weight would not	apply	against	the	limit	figured	by	half	(or	full)	Spirit	ML.
- Require	a	lengthy	designation	before	objects	can	be	affected, perhaps	requiring	a	Spirit	test	akin	to	Proximate	Attunement after	a	meditative	period	(one	hour,	for	instance).	Objects	not	so designated	would	not	be	affected,	regardless	of	the	weight	limit.
- Objects rejected when a character passes through a Godstone are instead	'stored'	by	the	Godstone,	retrieved	only	upon	returning	back to	this	initial	Godstone	as	a	destination.

## convocation degree option

Convocation	Degree	(page	200	sidebar)	ranges	from	0	to	4.	Alter these	to	increase	the	difficulty	of	learning	and	casting	spells.	For example,	perhaps	Primary	through	Neutral	remain	the	same	(0,	1,	2), but	Tertiary	increases	to	4	and	Diametric	becomes	6.

## fate &amp; aura options

- If	the	Fated	Test	has	an	EML05	or	less,	only	successes	(S	or	CS) on	this	initial	test	allow	for	a	subsequent	Fate	Roll.	Thus,	wildly improbable	actions	cannot	routinely	succeed	through	Fate	Rolls.
- A	PC	may	make	a	Fate	Roll	(Combat	Sunsign	Modifier)	to	adjust inversely	an attacker's missile	test.	For	example,	a	Fate	Roll	Success reduces the	missile	attack	by	one	Success	Level	at	the	cost	of	1	FP .
- Test	Aura	ML	as	a	measure	of	pure	luck,	even	opposed	against other's	such	luck	( who among the PCs is struck by the falling brick... ).

## gate spell

The GM dictates the location of Barasi Points with regard to the Gate spell	(page	252).	Thus,	in	the Capture version,	the	GM	retains	narrative control	over	just	where	destination	filaments	appear.	Mages	likely have been consulted during the construction of castles to assure none are	detected	terminating	within	or	near	their	confines.

## godstone option

Characters	who	have	perceived	the	True	Form	of	another	may	set	the destination	of	a	Godstone	to	within	a	foot	of	that	'target'.	The	usual Gateway	Destination	Modifiers	apply	(page	155),	including	a	special -20	True	Form	penalty	plus	the	target's	Aura	modifier.	For	example, such	a	perceived	target	with	an	AUR12	(+5	modifier)	contributes	-15 penalty	to	the	-20	Open	Space	and,	likely,	-20	Experience	penalties.

## advice &amp; options: the mysteries (2 of 2)

## incanting fatigue option

To	make	spellcasting	and	talent	invoking	more	taxing,	change	the fatigue	caused	by	incantation	from windedness to weariness (page	176). Thus,	while	the	amount	of	fatigue	accrued	at	spell-	or	talent-fire	does not	change,	the	time	to	recover	from	it	increases.	Even	10	windedness fatigue	can	be	reduced	in	20	minutes;	however,	10	weariness	fatigue remains	in	part	through	the	next	full	night's	sleep.	This	optional rule enhances the role of artefact Founts and other fatigue-sharing strategies.

- As	a	less	harsh	but	still	flavourful	option,	such	weariness	fatigue only	occurs	from	spell	or	talent	misfire	(CF).	That	accrued	from failure	(F)	and	successes	remains	windedness	fatigue.

## npc grace

GMs	could	assign	Grace	to	NPCs,	but,	since	miracles	usually	manifest mundanely,	any	expression	of	it	will	likely	have	already	taken	place throughout	the	course	of	an	NPC's	life.	For	instance,	the	rise	to	power of	a	certain	villain	may	have	included	the	effect	of	a	miracle-but	that has	already	transpired,	subsumed	into	whatever	mundane	narrative has	led	up	to	the	villain's	stature	in	the	game.

Also	note	that	NPCs	already	benefit	from	a	certain	'grace'-the GM's	ability	to	alter any NPC's	story	by	mere	fiat.	The	GM	can	even insert	Uncanny	Miracles	extemporaneously,	making	record-keeping of	mundane	expressions	of	Grace	somewhat	redundant.

## religion church languages option

While	clergy	perform	ceremonies	in	local	languages	their	followers understand,	many	religions	also	employ	special	church	languages in	official	correspondence.	Add	to	each	Priest	suboccupation	the following	Language	SM4	and	Script	SM4	skills,	except	where	noted:

| religion   | churchlanguage   | churchscript    |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Ágrik      | Zâkimladal       | Ayâran          |
| Haléa      | Karéjian         | Ayâran          |
| Ilvîr      | Bay Járin*       | Runic*          |
| Laráni     | Emélan           | Lakíse          |
| Môrgath    | Ôrmauk†          | Nùvesârl†       |
| Navéh      | Dálken           | Nerámic         |
| Peóni      | Emélan           | Lakíse          |
| Sárajìn    | Ivínian          | Runic           |
| Sávè-K'nôr | Zâkimladal       | Ayâran          |
| Siém       | Sináin/Kúzhan    | Selénian/Khrúni |

* Not	universal	to	the	church,	but	common	to	Ilviran	scholars	on	Hârn	(page	425). † Already developed as the secret language and script; no additional DP received.

## spell ml development option

Usually	mages	only	develop	Pvarism	ML,	through	either	Experience Points	or	Skill	Development	Rolls	(page	413).	Instead,	rule	that each Spell ML increases only through SDR awards from actual casting (+1 ML	per	SDR	success).	Pvarism	ML	is	increased	only	through	the	three monthly	SDR	awards	(or	through	XP).	Convocation	ML	and newly researched Spell	ML	are	derived,	as	usual,	from	Pvarism	ML.

## spell research option

Completing	spell	research	usually	takes	between	one	to	two	months, varying	by	spell	difficulty.	Before	the	spell	becomes	known	in	this	way, allow	mages	to	cast	a	'rudimentary'	version	of	the	spell	after	merely	10 + 1d6 + dif ×5	days,	but	only	by	referencing	their	grimoire	throughout casting	time.	This	is	similar	to	the	Grimoire	option	explained	in	the page	201	sidebar,	except	there	is	no	+10	bonus	and	the	spell	has	an ML equal to half of what it would have after full completion of the research.	Suffering	Crucial	Misfire	while	so	casting	means	all	the current	days	of	research	are	lost-the	mage	must	start	anew.

## spellcasting clergy option

Consider including esoterica as unique Ritual Devotions taught to high-Circle	clergy.	While	modelled	on	Pvarism,	each	such	spell	would be	its	own	skill	started	at	SM2	once	the	given	Circle	is	attained.	To perform,	clerics	begin	a	1-round	prayer	action	on	their	IR,	and	then make	the	Ritual	Devotion	Roll	(step	4,	page	319)	as	a	1-turn	action on	the	next	IR,	expending	1	Piety	if	called	for.	If	the	Ritual	Devotion succeeds,	they	must	enter	the	Spellcasting	Routine	on	the	third	IR (page	200).	When	made,	the	Casting	Roll	is	a	test	of	their	given	spellskill,	but	all	fatigue	accrual	is	weariness	rather	than	windedness.

Darkness (Naveh Circle IV): functions like Shadow (Odivshe II).

Halea's Voice (Halea	Circle	IV):	functions	like	Suggestion	(Savorya	VI).

Mutation (Ilvir	Circle	IV):	functions	like	Mask	(Neutral	V),	except	the	effect of Success (S) can include other body parts ( lengthening	a	finger ); CS can include more bizarre, random results ( growth of a tentacle ).

Searing Hand (Agrik Circle IV): functions like Elemental Bolt (Fire).

Tongues

Withering

(Save-K'nor Circle IV): functions like Converse (Neutral IV). (Morgath Circle IV): functions like Wasting (Fyvria IV).

## uncanny miracles

The	five	principles	listed	on	the	previous	page	under	Miracle Requests are the usual sources of the rare transgression against the Concordat	called	Uncanny	Miracles	(page	311).	Even	when	occurring, uncanny	miracles	could	still	be	subtle,	such	as	the	halo	of	crimson light	surrounding	Sir	Toneld	the	Virtuous	in	the	example	on	page	312. By	contrast,	some	GMs	may	prefer	to	include	quite	dramatic	miracles otherwise	denied,	such	as,	indeed,	extraordinarily	timed	meteor showers	and	earthquakes.	It	might	also	be	appropriate	for	especially strange	miracles	to	inflict	Psyche	Stress	on	witnesses.

Even	when	including	the	possibility	of	such	overt	miracles,	GMs should	keep	in	mind	that requesters can absolutely never dictate the specific	way	miracles	manifest ,	whether	they	are	mundane	or	uncanny. Such	volition	is	the	very	foundational	difference	between	the	esoteric and	the	divine.	The	gods/aspects	always	control	a	miracle's	guise.

## vessel spell duration option

In	order	to	highlight	even	more	the	mage's	own	crafting	skill	in	step	2 of	the	Minor	and	Major	Artefact	Creation	sequences	(pages	257-258), change	Vessel	spell's	artefact	Duration	to	the	following:

| object             | vessel artefactduration                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Obtained           | Temporary (CS Indefinite)                                |
| Crafted in consort | Indefinite (CS Indefinite or Permanent, caster's choice) |
| Crafted            | Temporary, Indefinite, or Permanent (caster's choice)    |

A	Temporary	Duration	equals	SI × 5	days.	If	Dispel	(Neutral	II)	is successfully	cast	on	the	Vessel	spell	of	such	an	artefact,	Vessel	and	all enchantments	are	removed.	The	mage	who	created	the	artefact	may also cancel its	enchantments,	just	like	for	an	Indefinite	artefact	(step 6,	page	257).	If	so,	the	Vessel	spell	remains	in	effect	if	there	is	still	any time	left	on	its	Duration.

Otherwise,	the	Vessel	spell	ends	after	SI × 5	days	Duration,	which removes	all	enchantments.	Mages	may	then	use	this	now	mundane object	as	an	Obtained	object	to	create	a	new	artefact.
