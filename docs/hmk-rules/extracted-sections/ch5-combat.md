Adventures in the world of Kethira can lead to combat. Political conflict might involve assassination, border raids, and the outright invasion of kingdoms and realms. Overland travel in many places includes the menace of brigands and roving bands of mercenaries. Sea and river voyages risk piracy and wreckers. Most dangerously, exploration into the world's remote corners often exposes characters to strange beasts and esoteric horror. re

## roleplaying combat

SC

When resolving combat, the GM vividly describes the environment of the battle, and the players report their character's actions within it. The open-ended Star approach to skill tests allows characters to perform special feats as spontaneously chosen by the players. Instead of narrowly defined combat abilities (' Mighty Blow '), the flexible system itself manifests the character's unique attacks and manoeuvres as narrated by the players. (p

## maps &amp; miniatures

Combats can be fought without the use of a formal map, especially those conflicts involving just a couple of participants. However, the rules also readily lend themselves to hobby miniatures and game boards.

## Melee

The melee rules make personal armed conflict quite consequential. Injuries accrue realistically-a single wellaimed blow can suddenly incapacitate a character, and those who die usually do so from bleeding. While cinema and fiction seem to exaggerate depictions of bravery, it is a simple fact that some folk perform quite exceptionally in response to violent threat. Fighting spirit alone very often distinguishes the victorious from the vanquished.

## melee routine

The Melee Routine most easily resolves small conflicts between up to about ten individuals. While it is called 'melee', the routine covers missiles, mounts, and esoteric actions. Morale also plays an important role.

One melee round represents about five seconds in the world. During each round , every character receives a turn . The GM and players may wish to narrate a character's action first and use the rules to express this description second. The game sequence should help manifest the unfolding drama rather than ploddingly constrain it.

The GM's first task is to establish and recount for the players the melee's environment. How far away are combatants? What is the terrain? Are there any special details that might affect actions, such as rain or darkness? After this general nature is established, the melee proceeds in rounds consisting of these five steps:

| [�] Alertness ..................................................page ���   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [�] Initiative ..................................................page ���  |
| [�] Engagement .............................................page ���       |
| [�] Actions ....................................................page ���   |
| [�] Morale.....................................................page ���    |

Scale: one round lasts five seconds. Distances are measured in feet but often referred to in five-foot increments called spaces . Groups using game maps can represent a space according to their preference-a hex, a square, or even an inch on tabletop terrain.

## encounter distance

The surrounding environment likely dictates how close opponents are at the start of combat. Skulking in the shadow of an alley puts characters within literal striking distance of passing targets; attacking a camp amid a sparse forest leaves a longer approach. For help establishing this distance, GMs can refer to the Awareness Distance table (page 150).
