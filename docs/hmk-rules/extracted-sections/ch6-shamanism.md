ASTRAL MYSTERIES

SHAMANISM

## Shamanism

The shaman is an occupation prevalent among most tribal societies on Kethira. Its practitioners develop techniques to undertake astral journeys, during which they beseech spirit entities and immerse with primal forces to grant them esoteric powers. While a given shaman might also practice magic through Natural Attunement and, even more likely, administer the tribe's religious practices through Ritual skill, shamanism itself is an astral mystery and thus distinct from both the arcane and divine.

The call to be a shaman often comes from lucid dreams or a near-death experience in childhood. It may also grow directly from the Disembodiment talent or stem from a familial legacy. Shamanism generally falls out of favour in a culture when manufacturing crafts and agriculture replace hunting and gathering, and when a professional, hierarchical clergy begins to regulate religious life, instead of a single person. The Guild of Arcane Lore found throughout the feudal and imperial realms has long since focused on the more direct, and dangerous, arcane arts. However personally developed, shamanism as a cultural force remains unique to tribal peoples, who rarely teach the mystery to even worthy strangers.

## Tradition

Each tribe practicing shamanism has its own tradition . Such traditions function not unlike the convocations for the Shek-Pvar, uniquely highlighting and limiting certain aspects of the Mystery. An overview of six tribal shamanic traditions found in Venarive is given on page 301.

Characters who are not native to a specific tribal society are considered outsiders to its tradition. They are limited even as targets in receiving shamanistic effects.

Folklore : an outsider with high Folklore might have knowledge of a tribe, but this does not equate to practicing its tradition. This requires years of direct contact even possibly to gain such acceptance.

## Shamanic Archetypes

Shaman is a social role made possible by membership in a tribal tradition. While the word 'shaman' is used throughout the rules, it can apply to several archetypes:

The Shaman is skilled in Trance, whether through meditation, chant, dance, or some other method. Such characters usually have the Shaman occupation, but they might have also developed the Trance skill while performing other roles, such as tribal chieftain.

The Sorcerer reaches the spirit world through arcane means. This is usually done with the Disembodiment arcane talent, or by way of Natural Attunement in the Lyahvi convocation and training in the Figure spell.

299

The Priest is often a role filled by a shaman or sorcerertraditions vary as to the presence and extent of the Ritual skill. However, the role of 'shaman' in some tribes might be subsumed in a more prominent priestly figure.

The Stranger could start out as an outsider but, through exceptional talent and many years of deep acceptance, could rise to fill the tradition's role of shaman.

## shamanic astral journey

From whatever the tradition and archetype, a shaman must be able to lift the veil that separates the spirit world from the physical world. As detailed in the Astral Journey routine (page 291), several techniques accomplish this, the most prevalent of which is the Trance skill. Through dance, chant, or meditation, shamans develop the ability to reach such an ecstatic state that inhabitation and perspective switch from their body in the landscape to their soul in the astralscape. Shamans may employ such techniques to lift the veil for three different reasons-to petition Spirit Guides , to perform Rites , and to bestow Talismans .

## Spirit Guides

A shaman undertakes an astral journey in the spirit world to seek out three types of spirit guides .

Ancestor Spirits (page 302): the active souls of deceased tribal members often linger in the astralscape to provide insight into skills pertinent to their people's way of life.

Totem Spirits (page 303): the active souls of creatures can connect with shamans on an instinctual level to impart unique gifts and enhance physical and mental abilities.

Energy Spirits (page 305): Principle and Place Energy, viewed as 'spirits' by tribal peoples, give shamans the chance to manipulate mundane air, earth, fire, and water.

The kind of spirit guides emphasised varies according to tradition. Ancestor and Totem Spirits are also rated according to their Spirit Estrangement with the shaman.

## the petition

Once on an astral journey, the shaman must perform a Spirit Sensing action to find the desired spirit guide (Astral Journey Routine, step 3.2). If successful, the shaman must then petition the spirit for a power by successfully engaging in Spirit Communion (step 3.3). Only characters of a given tradition may petition its spirit guides for powers.

Each petitioned power requires its own Spirit Communion Roll, although the same spirit guide may be the target of several different petitions during the same journey. When lifting the veil through the Trance skill, the journey lasts Will Index rounds. Other techniques, such as experiencing a Lucid Dream, might vary this length.

## spirit power anima

Ancestor, Totem, and Energy Spirit Powers are rated from one to three Anima Levels (I-III), reflecting the magnitude of effect. The total levels of successfully petitioned powers-called the anima burden-cannot exceed the shaman's Spirit Index:

## total anima levels  ≤  spirit index

Once the shaman configures, or 'stores', an array of powers, it remains the same until changed during a different astral journey (if desired). The shaman accrues no fatigue to store or use spirit powers.

Talismans : Spirit Powers for which a shaman wishes to bestow talismans cost one extra anima point when figuring the above burden against Spirit Index.

Aural Shock : when suffering from Aural Shock, shamans lose the ability to make Trance and Spirit skill tests, as they are both based upon Aura. Upon recovery, the shaman makes a Spirit test for each configured power. Any success means the power remains stored; any failure means it has been lost. The shaman must make a new spirit journey to petition for lost powers or to replace them with others.

## Rites

Shamans perform rites to share astral wisdom with their community. They select a rite associated with a stored Anima III Spirit Power-an Ancestor Rite (page 302), Totem Rite (page 303), or Energy Rite (page 305).

Any number may take part in the rite as long as the participants remain near the shaman. The location usually corresponds to an astral locale considered hallowed to the people. The shaman does not receive the Rite Benefit.

[�] Time : spend 15 - Trance Index hours dancing, chanting, singing, or exhorting, according to tradition.

[�] Test : the shaman tests Trance on the following table.

## rite performance

- cf No effect plus shaman must test Will : a Failure (F) cause Aural Shock � (CF 3) .
- f No	effect.
- s Participants receive the Rite Benefit with a successful Spirit SR*.
- cs Participants receive the Rite Benefit with a successful Spirit SR*	(+2	bonus	to	roll).

* Outsiders	must	succeed	on	two	such	Spirit	SR	to	receive	the	Rite	Benefit.

[�] Duration : the benefit lasts 30 days; a participant who suffers Aural Shock loses the benefit.

## Talismans

Shamans may share stored Ancestor or Totem Spirit Powers by bestowing a talisman to a willing recipient, other than themselves (pages 302 and 303). The object requires no crafting but must reflect the tradition-a shark's tooth, a small pouch of soil, a piece of tree bark. Shamans may bestow any number of talismans, one per recipient, if the Power's extra point of anima burden has been paid (see Talismans, left).

[�] Time : spend 15 - Trance Index minutes dancing, chanting, singing, or exhorting, according to tradition.

[�] Test : the shaman tests Trance on the following table.

## talisman bestowal

- cf No effect plus shaman must test Will : a Failure (F) causes Aural Shock equal	to	the	talisman's	Anima	level	(CF	+1).
- f No	effect;	recipient	must	wait	30	days	for	a	new	bestowal	test.
- s Talisman	bestowed	to	designated	recipient.
- cs Talisman	bestowed;	increase	base	period	by	two	days.

[�] Duration : recipients must wear or carry talismans. Bestowals last for a base period of days equal to the shaman's Spirit Index (+2 for CS Trance bestowal result) . At the end of the period, the recipient makes a Spirit SR -a success extends the bestowal for another base period (Outsiders must succeed on two Spirit SR to extend it). Talismans retain effect until the recipient suffers Aural Shock, fails the Spirit SR, or loses possession of it for a day.

## kath

The	Kath	are	nomadic	hunters	and	gatherers	of	western	Hârn, descendants of ancient Pharic people who invaded the island centuries	ago.	Having	no	permanent	settlements,	the	Kath	roam their	ancestral	forested	hills	in	bands	of	20-30	members,	with	each band	dedicated	to	one	of	six	totems-Bear,	Boar,	Lion,	Stag,	Wolf, or	Eagle.	These	bands	rarely	fight	each	other,	and	men	and	women function	equally	in	all	roles,	whether	as	hunter,	herder,	or	chief.

Kath	shamans	live	and	wander	alone,	practicing	meditative trance	often	enhanced	through	herbal	drugs.	They	focus	mostly on	their	specific	Totem	Spirit	Powers	but	will	often	seek	Ancestral ones	enhancing	Survival	and	Tracking	skills.	A	shaman	known	as	the Green	Witch	is	a	reported	shapechanger	and	likely	natural	incanter, supposedly	able	to	enchant	pelts	that	transform	those	donning	them.

## kùbôra

A	Jarin	people	of	the	forests	and	hills	of	western	Hârn,	the

Kubora embrace all forms of combat-whether rituallike	skirmishes	between	neighbouring bands	or	deadly	guerilla	ambushes	against mounted feudal enemies from the lands to the	south.	Kubora	of	all	ages	and	sexes practice	facial	branding	as	a	way of distinguishing status and expressing	personal	history. Such	mutilation-known as arus -enhances	their	fierce reputation,	as	does	their	merciless treatment	of	captives.

Kuboran	shamans	greatly value Ancestor Spirit Powers that enhance	fighting	skills.	While having	a	less	overtly	totemistic tradition than other tribal peoples,	they	tend	to	promote totems	of	the	warrior,	such	as the	Bear	and	Boar.	Kuborans view dreams as messages from the gods,	and	shamans	describe	their	astral journeys	to	obtain	their	powers	as	a	direct response	to	such	missives.

## neshái

Among the northern reaches of the Anzelorian jungle live the Magara,	one	of	two	tribes	of	the	Neshai	people	who	inhabit	the southern	edge	of	Venarive.	The	Magara	dwell	in	villages	of	about	a hundred	people,	mostly	in	the	lowlands	around	the	Bay	of	Nagone. They	practice	swidden	agriculture,	forage,	and	fish	the	swift	rivers	in their mashu ,	narrow	boats	for	one	or	two	people.

While	they	worship	the	warrior	god	Kelana,	the	dozen	types of spirits called rohiro figure	more	prominent	in	their	prayers.	The Magara have a dedicated caste of shaman called kuhani ,	who	dwell apart	from	the	villages	near	pyramid	temple	complexes.	Up	to	a score	shamans	and	their	acolytes	live	near	these	ancient	sites,	relying on	tithes	from	their	tribe	for	food	and	material.	Ancestor	Powers are	most	popular,	usually	gained	from	the	spirits	of	past	chiefs.	The Magara	are	a	people	isolated	even	from	their	more	'civilised'	kin	to the	south;	they	aggressively	defend	their	more	traditional	way	of	life.

## sample shamanic traditions

## quârph

Tall,	blond,	and	light-skinned,	the	Quarph	of	north-central	Venarive dwell	mostly	in	nomadic	clan	groups	of	20	to	60	related	people.	Many subsist	in	the	wooded	and	grassy	plains	by	hunting,	trapping,	fishing, and	foraging,	keeping	cattle	for	milk	and	practicing	basic	agriculture. Some	groups	establish	fortified	villages,	and	even	a	few	Quarphic tributary	states	have	developed	around	scattered	market	towns.

The Quarph practice both ritualistic worship in temples and shamanism.	Each	tribal	unit	usually	has	both	a	male	and	a	female shaman-priest	who	embody	respectively	the	sun	spirit,	Anulome, and	the	moon	spirit,	Diyel.	The	two	are	often	a	married	couple.	They greatly	venerate	animal	spirits,	focusing	on	totem	powers	and	the Energy	Rite	of	air,	interpreting	their	oracular	visions	as	messages from	both	beasts	and	their	two	sky	gods.

## alts

While	most	of	the	Altic	people	in	the	wildlands	of	northern	Venarive have	established	farming	and	fishing	communities,	a	great	deal still	remain	nomadic.	Of	their	four	groups-Water, Forest,	Valley,	and	Great-all	but	the	wealthier Valley	Alts	practice	some	form	of	seasonal migration.	The	Great	Alts	retain	the	most traditional customs and remain the most isolated in the forested mountains and cold	river	basins.

An	Altic	shaman	usually	petitions ancestor	spirits	for	skills	to	help with	a	tribe's	hunting,	trapping, fishing,	and	herding.	While	the Alts	are	not	as	strictly	totemistic compared	with	other	traditions, the Reindeer retains a strong practical	and	symbolic	role, talismans of which impart powers	like	those	of	the	Stag. Water and Earth are dominant among	the	Energy	spirits,	with Air spirit powers also used to mitigate	the	harsh	weather.

## tuvâran

The Tuvaran are nomadic cattle herders of the savannah of northern Anzeloria.	They	are	tall	with	jet-black	skin,	and,	by	reputation,	a striking	people.	Most	live	in	groups	of	about	10	families	in	villages that	are	moved	at	least	twice	a	year;	a	minority	live	in	permanent settlements	along	a	river,	some	of	which	house	a	thousand	people. They	are	a	strictly	patriarchal	society,	divided	into	four	nations,	with each	expressing	its	own	dialect	of	Tuvaran.

Shamans are counted among the mjena ,	a	class	of	taboo occupations	whose	members	lead	wandering,	yet	respected,	lives. While	Tuvaran	religion	revolves	around	the	worship	of	Kelana,	god of	strength	and	creator	of	cattle,	the	shaman	is	kept	apart	from	its communal	rituals.	Tuvaran	shamans	often	express	arcane	Talents, which	can	dramatically	deepen	their	external	status	in	society.	They pursue	a	wide	variety	of	shamanic	powers,	and	are	especially	known for	incorporating	beadwork	talismans	into	their	people's	jewellery.

## Ancestor Spirits

Much of tribal lore stems from and resides within Ancestor Spirits. These active souls, rather than passing beyond to Yashain upon death, instead linger in the astralscape near their people's most sacred land. Here they receive petitions from the tribe's shaman for wisdom and knowledge.

## estrangement

Shamans begin a campaign with a Popular spirit estrangement with their Ancestor Spirit guide. Certain specific tribal traditions might adjust this starting level.

## Ancestor Spirit Powers

When petitioning an Ancestor Spirit guide, the Shaman designates a skill from the following table. Some skills might not be appropriate to a given tribe. For instance, Seamanship and Piloting would be unavailable to a shaman of a people with no sailing or boating tradition.

## ancestor skills

| Agriculture   | Fishing     | Musician   | Survival    |
|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Animalcraft   | Fletching   | Physician  | Throwing    |
| Archery       | Folklore    | Piloting   | Timbercraft |
| Brewing       | Herblore    | Riding     | Tracking    |
| Command       | Hideworking | Seamanship | Weaponcraft |
| Cookery       | Language    | Shipwright | Woodworking |
| Discourse     | Melee*      | Sling      |             |

* Includes	applying	the	same	Anima	power	effect	to	Dodge.

After designating the skill, the shaman petitions for it as an Anima I, Anima II, or Anima III power through Spirit Communing (page 295). A Shaman may only store one Ancestor Spirit Power for the same skill-the Anima I, II, or III version-but may concurrently store other Ancestor Spirit Powers for other skills.

Language / Musician : designate respectively one foreign or native language, or instrument, common to the tradition.

## anima i

If the Spirit Communion Roll for the petition is successful, the spirit power gives the shaman two indefinite Mastery Boosts in the given skill. If the shaman has no ML in the skill, then the ML equals Skill Base (SB) plus one Mastery Boost. The shaman's new ML cannot exceed SB × 7.

The ML boosts last until the power is relinquished to configure a new array, or the shaman suffers Aural Shock.

## anima ii

As for Anima I, except the power gives three Mastery Boosts-or SB plus two boosts if the shaman has no ML.

## anima iii

As for Anima I, except the power gives four Mastery Boosts -or SB plus three boosts if the shaman has no ML.

While suffering Aural Shock, a shaman loses any ML increases to skills gained from Ancestor Spirit Powers. Once Aural Shock ends, the ML increase from a spirit power is restored if the Spirit test (page 300) succeeds. For ease of bookkeeping, the player should track spirit power ML increases separately from the character's ML attained through standard development.

## Ancestor Rite

To perform an Ancestor Rite, the shaman first selects a skill associated with an already stored Anima III Ancestor Spirit Power. If the shaman is successful in the Rite Performance test (page 300), participants who take part for the entire time each make a Spirit SR. A success grants them one Mastery Boost in the selected skill. If a participant has no ML in the skill, then there is no effect. Participants may only benefit from one Ancestor Rite for the same skill. The effect lasts for participants until they suffer Aural Shock or the rite's 30-day duration expires.

## Ancestor Talisman

Shamans may share a stored Anima I, II, or III Ancestor Spirit Power by successfully bestowing it as an Ancestor Talisman to a willing recipient (page 300). Talismans give one fewer Mastery Boost to the recipient than the same Anima level does to the shaman. For example, an Anima I Talisman bestows only one Mastery boost if the recipient already has an ML, or an ML equal to SB if not.

A given recipient may receive only one Ancestor Talisman affecting the same skill but may receive several affecting different skills. Each Talisman remains in effect as long as the recipient's periodic Spirit SR (page 300) are successful, or until the recipient suffers Aural Shock or is parted from the talisman for a day.

The same recipient may also benefit from an Ancestor Rite for the identical skill. However, their Mastery Boosts do not combine (they overlap). Thus, the effect or duration of one source could end, while the other remains.

<!-- image -->

## Totem Spirits

Tribal societies usually celebrate a kinship with one or more animals, sometimes varying according to certain social subgroups or individuals within the tribe. Each shamanic tradition describes such details.

The spirit world home of totem spirits most often corresponds to the deep wilderness places where the animals resided during their life in the physical world. Thus, petitioning them for power usually requires the shaman to take a Spirit Roaming action to reach such distant astral locales. With low Auras, the souls of totem spirits are also difficult for shamans to identify in the astralscape, even when they do reach them.

A totem symbolises the instinctual characteristics that define the behaviour and essential nature of an animal. The variety is vast, with each type of animal represented in the spirit world by its ideal form. Twelve sample totems are detailed in the Totem Instincts table on page 304: Bear, Boar, Bull, Crow, Eagle, Fox, Horse, Lion, Snake, Stag, Whale, and Wolf. These reflect animals common to most regions of Venarive; GMs and players may use these as templates to devise additional ones.

## estrangement

Shamans begin a campaign with an Accepted spirit estrangement with their Totem Spirit guide. Certain traditions might modify this level or allow a choice of one among several totem creatures, in which case the shaman has a separate Estrangement for each Totem Spirit.

Transmutation : shamans possessing the Transmutation arcane talent (page 264) increase the starting Totem Spirit estrangement by one level with the talent's associated animal.

## Totem Spirit Powers

When petitioning a Totem Spirit guide, the shaman specifies the creature-totem and then an Anima I, Anima II, or Anima III power. Shamans may store only one Totem Spirit Power of only one totem type at a time. They lose the benefits of the totem power while suffering from Aural Shock, and, upon recovery, must make a Spirit test to see if it is restored (page 300). Otherwise, totem powers last until they are relinquished to reconfigure a new array.

Psyche Trait : upon reembodiment after successfully petitioning for a Totem Spirit Power, the shaman acquires a number of Psyche Stress Levels equal to the Anima level. The accompanying psyche trait reflects the totem and is usually a bit bizarre or eccentric (see the Totem Instincts table, page 304). While undergoing Psyche Stress Recovery (page 189), the shaman does not suffer the usual weakness fatigue and, in fact, often embraces the intensified totem instinct.

## anima i

If the Spirit Communion Roll for the petition is successful, the shaman receives the great instinct associated with the totem, as explained on page 304.

## anima ii

As for Anima I, plus the shaman automatically obtains a telepathic link with any creature of the totem within Spirit ML feet. The link grants direct two-way communication, but is limited to simple emotions and intentions.

As a 1-turn action, the shaman may try to establish such a link with any domesticated or wild animal within half Spirit ML feet. In an opposed Spirit test, the shaman forms the link with a success level exceeding the animal's (break successful ties). On a one-star failure, the animal flees, or attacks if it has an aggressive nature; a two- or three-star failure induces an attack no matter its nature. A successful link lasts the shaman's Spirit Index rounds.

## anima iii

As for Anima I and II, but the shaman may also take a one-turn action to make an opposed Spirit test with any creature of the totem within Spirit ML feet. If the shaman generates a higher success level (break successful ties), then the shaman's sensory perspective switches to the creature's for one minute per star success, however far it roams. A failure prevents more attempts with the specific creature for 24 hours (CF with any creature of its type).

During this time, shamans still inhabit their body-the perspective change is similar to Clairvoyance-and they must maintain concentration or the perspective switches back to them. The shaman may command the animal with a successful Spirit (Command) test, but two consecutive failures or a single CF ends the sensory effect for 24 hours.

## Totem Rite

A shaman with a stored Anima III Totem Spirit Power may make a Rite Performance test (page 300). If successful, other participants each make their own Spirit SR, a success of which grants them the totem's mild instinct . Participants may benefit from only one Totem Rite at a time. The effect lasts for participants until they suffer Aural Shock or the rite's 30-day duration expires.

## Totem Talisman

A shaman with a stored Anima III Totem Spirit Power may make a Talisman Bestowal test (page 300) for a willing recipient. If successful, the recipient receives the totem's strong instinct . Only one Totem Talisman may be bestowed to the same recipient at the same time. The Talisman remains in effect as long as the recipient's periodic Spirit SR are successful, or until the recipient suffers Aural Shock, or is parted from the talisman for a day.

The same recipient may also benefit from a Totem Rite for the identical totem, but the bonuses do not combine.

<!-- image -->

Each Totem has instinctual characteristics consisting of a Benefit and a Psyche .

benefit :	when	three	benefits	are	listed,	such as	+5/+10/+15,	they	refer	to	the	mild,	strong, and great instincts, respectively. Mild and strong instincts are only granted to others through Totem Rites and Talismans, each lasting according to their own durations (page 303). A shaman receives a great instinct, whether with an Anima I, II, or III Spirit Power. It lasts until the Spirit	Power	is	reconfigured	or	lost	(page	300).

psyche : this is a description of the psyche trait the shaman acquires during the accompanying Psyche Stress Recovery (page 189). The psyche trait lasts until the PSY levels are recovered, a process which carries the usual chance of the trait becoming an Impulse or Disorder and/or increasing	from	an	indefinite	to	a	permanent duration. Even once the shaman recovers from the totem's Psyche Stress, the instinct benefit still lasts as long as the Spirit Power does.

## bear

benefit : melee and thrown weapon impact rolls receive +1/+2/+3 bonus; a great instinct also improves unarmed impacts	by	1	more. All	bonuses	also	apply	to	the	d6 + STR	result of	Grab	(Hold)	Rolls	and	Press	Rolls.

psyche :	the	shaman	becomes	quieter, even	shy	around	strangers;	others	seem	to mistake	such	introversion	as	an	intimidating reserve.	Long	spans	of	contemplation	lead the	character	to	distraction,	which	often makes	them	clumsy	or	blundering.

## boar

benefit :	Initiative	tests	and	Initiative	Rank receive +5/+10/+15 bonus; a great instinct also	improves	Morale	Rolls	by	5	more.

psyche :	the	shaman	becomes	more	wilful, stubborn about even small matters; when impeded	or	contradicted,	the	character suddenly	lashes	out	with	a	vehement	and often	unruly	obstinacy.

## bull

benefit :	Shock	tests	receive	+5/+10/+15 bonus;	if	the	Shock	State	is	8	or	higher before	the	roll,	then	a	great	instinct improves	the	Shock	test	bonus	by	5	more.

psyche :	the	shaman's	decision-making becomes	more	unpredictable,	and	their physical	gait	is	more	lurching;	their	actions seem uncertain and express a more disruptive,	even	destructive,	nature.

## totem instincts

## crow

benefit :	Folklore	tests	receive	+5/+10/+15 bonus;	a	great	instinct	improves	by	5	more tests	involving	knowledge	of	the	three Mysteries	(that	is,	not	actual	incanting tests,	but	Folklore	tests	about	pantheons	or Godstones,	for	instance).

psyche : the shaman becomes more mischievous; a dismissiveness concerning disagreements	turns	especially	vindictive when	the	shaman's	intelligence	is	doubted.

## eagle

benefit : Intrigue tests receive +5/+10/+15 bonus;	a	great	instinct	improves	Conspiracy Rolls	by	5	more.

psyche :	the	shaman's	manner	becomes blunt and impatient; what the character views	as	shrewd	and	decisive,	others	see	as predatory	and	even	merciless.

## fox

benefit : Guile tests receive +5/+10/+15 bonus;	a	great	instinct	improves	by	5	more Guile	tasks	involving	bluffing.

psyche :	the	shaman	dissembles,	even	when not	seemingly	beneficial;	when	angered, the	character's	idle	manipulations	become deceitful	and	hurtful.

## horse

benefit :	Animalcraft	and	Riding	tests receive +5/+10/+15 bonus; a great instinct grants to Riding tests involving horses an additional	+5	bonus.

psyche :	the	shaman's	attention	wanders, producing a great desire to roam and eschew the familiar; what the character describes	as	freedom-loving,	others	view	as undisciplined	and	irresponsible.

## lion

benefit : Stealth tests for both hiding and stalking	receive	+5/+10/+15	bonus;	if	the	test is	made	while	making	at	least	a	half	Move, then	a	great	instinct	improves	the	bonus	by 5	more.

psyche : the shaman becomes more egotistical;	an	imperious	indifference	often strikes	others	as	laziness,	an	impression the	character's	penchant	for	inactivity	only deepens.

## snake

benefit : Theatrics tests receive +5/+10/+15 bonus;	a	great	instinct	improves	by	5	more tests	involving	disguise.

psyche : the shaman becomes more guarded,	even	secretive	with	those	they otherwise	trust;	the	character	seeks	to control	others	from	the	shadows.

## stag

benefit : Fate Rolls receive +5/+10/+15 bonus; a	great	instinct	increases	this	by	5	more	if Dodge	or	Agility	is	the	Fated	test.

psyche : the shaman becomes more agreeable,	to	the	point	of	naiveté;	when under	stress,	or	when	deceived,	the character	is	slow	to	react,	even	timid.

## whale

benefit :	Charm	skill	receives	+5/+10/+15 bonus;	a	great	instinct	improves	by	5	more tasks	involving	inspiration.

psyche :	the	shaman's	manner	becomes more		overbearing	than	charismatic,	or perhaps	more	oily	than	suave;	if	leadership is	frustrated,	the	character	resorts	to intimidation,	or	cunning.

## wolf

benefit :	Awareness	skill	receives	+5/+10/+15 bonus;	a	great	instinct	improves	by	5	more tests	involving	the	sense	of	smell.

psyche :	the	shaman	becomes	ever	vigilant, which,	during	moments	of	calm,	unsettles others	as	paranoia;	when	not	heeded,	the character's	warnings	turn	aggressive

a

## skill versus instinct

Ancestor Spirit Powers (page 302) increase	a	character's	Mastery	Level (ML),	usually	in	a	Craft,	Lore,	or	Nature skill.	This	reflects	authentic	cultural knowledge	imparted	by	the	souls	of wise	ancestors.	This	benefit	increases the	recipient's	ML,	just	like	personal development.

The	benefits	of	Totem	Spirit	Powers, instead,	reflect	an	animalistic	powernot	actual	knowledge	of	a	skill	but rather an enhancement of an instinctive response	or	action	closely	tied	to	the beast.	Totem	Powers,	thus,	affect character abilities through bonuses rather	than	inherently	raising	them.

## Energy Spirits

Shamans refer colloquially to ethereal energies as 'spirits' even though they are not entities according to the Pvaric model of Kelestia. Shamans use Spirit Sensing to find such Principle and Place energy, just like when searching for Ancestor and Totem Spirits. However, the shaman's subsequent petition is not by way of Spirit Communing but rather through Spirit Immersion (page 296).

## spirit immersion

Shamans can seek immersion with four types of Energy Spirit guides: air , earth , fire , or water . Some traditions might prevent access to certain energies and promote others. While identical to the corresponding Pvaric types, shamanically immersed energy allows for powers that function more mundanely than the strange manifestations often resulting from arcane channelling.

Shamans carry no estrangement with Energy Spirits since such forces do not possess the personality of a living entity. However, there are other risks in 'petitioning' them for powers: the shaman's soul can suffer dissolution from critically failing the necessary Spirit Immersion roll; and the process can prove psychically traumatic.

## Energy Spirit Powers

Energy Spirit Powers grant the shaman the ability to manipulate naturally existing energy. They enhance the shaman's contribution to the survival of the tribechanging unfavourable winds, enhancing curative herbs, increasing warmth-rather than provide bizarre contortions of reality (the aegis of the arcane).

When seeking immersion with an Energy Spirit guide, the Shaman specifies either an Anima I, Anima II, or Anima III power of the same energy corresponding to the spirit's. See the specific twelve entries on the following two pages-one power for three levels of all four energies.

## energy wielding

The anima levels of the Energy Spirit Powers count against the maximum amount, as usual. However, unlike Ancestor and Totem Spirit Powers, whenever a conscious shaman wishes to express an Energy Spirit Power, they must also make an Energy Wielding Roll using the following routine:

[�] Test : Trance skill. All types of fatigue apply. A Grievous skull injury or being stunned prevent it altogether (all other impairment has no effect).

[�] Time : 10 minutes. The shaman performs the tribe's traditional technique, such as dance, chant, or meditation. This rite is a shorter version of the one used to enter a Trance to Lift the Veil (page 291).

[�] Roll : after the uninterrupted 10-minute rite, the shaman tests Trance as a 1-turn action on the Energy Wielding table, below.

## energy wielding

- cf no effect : shaman tests Will ;	Failure	(F)	induces	Aural	Shock equal	to	the	energy	power's	associated	Anima	level	(CF	+1).
- f no effect .
- s energy power manifests :	see	entries	on	pages	306-307.
- cs energy power manifests :	the	single	next	Energy	Wielding test	with	this	same	energy	receives	+20	bonus.	There	might	be additional	effects	according	to	each	Energy	Power.

[�] Result : if successful, apply the effect of the Energy Spirit Power. There is no fatigue accrual.

Energy Wielding Roll Example : Tyrus has a stored Anima III Fire Energy Power and Trance ML72, and stands next to a sputtering campfire in a cold rain (Fire Size 0, page 307). He enters a quiet meditation for ten minutes, waving his hand over the nearly inert fire. The Energy Wielding Roll is 43, a Trance Success (S). Over the next few seconds, the weak flames suddenly grow to engulf the campfire's extent (FS 2). With the cold rain abating, Tyrus adds a few logs to keep it burning.

## Energy Spirit Rite

To perform an Energy Rite, the shaman must have a stored Anima III Energy Spirit Power. The rite induces an oracular revelation through the interpretation of the Spirit Energy-from listening to the wind, handling rocks, gazing into flame, or stirring water. In place of the usual test in step 2 of a Rite (page 300), the shaman makes a Trance Success Value test on the following table. The other steps remain the same as for any Rite, including a 30-day duration, regardless of the outcome.

## sv trance success value test

- ≤ 4 cloudy future : the	shaman	fails	to	generate	any	revelation.
- 5 1 oracle : for	each	resulting	star,	one	d10	is	rolled	separately
- for	each	participant*	and	the	shaman.	Each	d10	result 6 2
- that exceeds their own current FP total increases their FP 7 3
- who	had	5	or	more	FP	before	the	oracle.	For	more	details, 8 4
- amount	by	1.	Such	additional	FPs	even	apply	to	recipients
- see	Divination	Readings	(page	280). 9+ 5

* For each d10,	outsiders	must	succeed	on	a	Spirit	SR	to	receive	it. Critical Failure : the shaman tests Will ; a Failure (F) causes Aural Shock	2	(CF	3).

Oracle Example : Tyrus, who has a stored Anima III Fire Energy Power and Trance ML72, performs an Energy Spirit Rite. A roll of 84 produces SV6-a two-star oracle. Each participant receives two d10 rolls to increase FP . Eldir, a participating outsider, succeeds on only one Spirit SR, so receives only one such d10 roll.

## Energy Spirit Talisman

There are no Energy Spirit Talismans. The exoticness of ethereal energy immersion makes it impossible for the shaman to share it in the weaker quantities of a talisman.

## air spirit powers

Air spirit guides are associated with mountain aeries and open sky. Their granted powers affect either the temperature or the wind , so designated only at the moment the shaman makes the Energy Wielding Roll.

Air Spirit Powers also give the shaman +5 bonus per Anima to the	Will	test	in	holding	one's	breath	(page	183) .

## anima i

Temperature : the shaman attempts to change the day's temperature. If the Energy Wielding Roll succeeds, one additional d10 Temperature Roll is made for the day (page 144). The shaman's player picks which of the two results applies. The shaman may only wield a Temperature power-of any Anima-once per day. Its effect manifests naturally over the next d4 hours (Energy Wielding CS: 3d6 minutes), and only applies within ten leagues from where the shaman wields the energy.

Wind : the shaman attempts to change the prevailing windforce ( wf ). There is no effect on direction.

|   wf | force    | effect         | kph   | d100   |
|------|----------|----------------|-------|--------|
|    0 | Light    | leaves rustle  | 0-8   | 01-15  |
|    1 | Moderate | branchesmove   | 9-24  | 16-55  |
|    2 | Strong   | tree tops sway | 25-48 | 56-84  |
|    3 | Gale     | branches break | 49-88 | 85-99  |
|    4 | Storm    | trees uprooted | ≤ 89  | 100    |

The GM selects the current WF, or rolls d100 in the last column to determine it. If the Energy Wielding Roll succeeds, the shaman makes a new d100 roll on the same column, choosing its result or the current WF. The shaman may only wield a Wind power-of any Anima-once per day. A new WF manifests naturally over the next d4 hours (Energy Wielding CS: 3d6 minutes), and only applies within ten leagues from where the shaman wields the energy. A new WF last four hours after manifesting.

## anima ii

Temperature : as for Anima I (Temperature), except that two additional dice are rolled, and the player selects the desired result from among the three.

Wind : as for Anima I (Wind), except the shaman makes two additional d100 rolls to choose from.

## anima iii

Temperature : as for Anima I (Temperature), except that three additional dice are rolled, and the player selects the desired result from among the four.

Wind : as for Anima I (Wind), except the shaman makes three additional d100 rolls to choose from.

## earth spirit powers

Earth spirit guides are connected with verdant forests and dark caves. Their powers either enhance the shaman's survival fortune or the potency of herbs , so designated at the moment the shaman makes the Energy Wielding Roll.

Earth Spirit Powers also give the shaman +5 bonus per Anima in	Advance	Rolls	of	starvation	(page	186).

## anima i

Survival : the shaman's sensitivity to finding food, water, and herbs increases. If the Energy Wielding Roll is a success, one additional d10 is rolled on the Foraging Results table (page 147) for the ensuing four-hour watch. The shaman's player picks which of the two results applies. The shaman may only wield a Survival power-of any Anima-once per day.

Herbs : the shaman attempts to extract a greater effect from a fresh herb. If the Energy Wielding Roll succeeds, one additional d10 is rolled when determining the Potency of a herb harvested during the past four-hour watch (page 74). The shaman's player chooses which of the two results to apply. If more than one dose was harvested, the bonus Potency roll applies to only one of them. The shaman may only wield a Herbs power-of any Anima-once per day.

## anima ii

Survival : as for Anima I (Survival), except that two additional dice are rolled, and the player selects the desired result from among the three.

Herbs : as for Anima I (Herbs), except that two additional d10 are rolled, and the player selects the desired potency result from among the four. If more than one dose was harvested during the Foraging Routine, the shaman may assign one bonus die to two separate doses, or apply both bonus dice to one of the doses.

## anima iii

Survival : as for Anima I (Survival), except that three additional dice are rolled, and the player selects the desired result from among the four.

Herbs : as for Anima I (Herbs), except that three additional d10 are rolled, and the player selects the desired potency result from among the three. If more than one dose was harvested during the Foraging Routine, the shaman may assign the bonus dice to several different doses (in any combination) or all to the same dose.

## fire spirit powers

Fire spirit powers manifest near hot springs and active volcanoes. A shaman granted their powers may manipulate a fire's flame or enhance its warmth , so designated only at the moment the shaman makes the Energy Wielding Roll.

Fire Spirit Powers also give the shaman +5 bonus per Anima in cold	and	heat	exposure	Advance	Rolls	(page	185).

## anima i

Flame : the shaman attempts to increase or decrease a flame's Fire Size (FS):

|   fs | amount      | diameter   | examples        |
|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
|    0 | Scant       | 1 in       | censer, lantern |
|    1 | Trace       | 1 ft       | torch           |
|    2 | Minor       | 3 ft       | campfire        |
|    3 | Substantial | 10 ft      | large fire      |
|    4 | Great       | 20ft       | bonfire         |

If the Energy Wielding Roll succeeds, the Fire Size of an extant fire increases or decreases by 1 (shaman's choice). The change takes place gradually over the next round. There is no effect if no fire exists before the roll, and the flame increases only to the natural limits of the fire's available fuel. It then burns for its natural length of time. If reduced to less than a trace, the fire goes out. An increased large fire instead burns twice as fast as usual. The shaman may only wield a Flame power-of any Anima-once on the same extant fire.

Warmth : if the Energy Wielding Roll succeeds, the effective heat given off by an extant fire increases by 1 FS. There is no effect if no fire exists before the roll, and the fire burns for its natural length of time. The shaman may only wield a Warmth power-of any Anima-once on the same extant fire.

## anima ii

Flame : as for Anima I (Flame), except the shaman may increase or decrease the flame by 2 FS.

Warmth : as for Anima I (Warmth), except the shaman may increase the effective heat by 2 FS.

## anima iii

Flame : as for Anima I (Flame), except that the shaman may increase or decrease the flame by 3 FS.

Warmth : as for Anima I (Warmth), except the shaman may increase the effective heat by 3 FS.

## water spirit powers

Water spirit powers occur in rivers, lakes, and seas. Their powers give a shaman control over currents or precipitation , so designated only at the moment the shaman makes the Energy Wielding Roll.

Water Spirit Powers also give the shaman +5 bonus per Anima in	Advance	Rolls	when	suffering	thirst	(page	186).

## anima i

Current : the shaman attempts to modify the Current Force (CUR) of one body of water that naturally produces current (a completely stagnant pond could not be affected). Speeds are given in feet per second and feet per combat round:

|   cur | --speed--   | --speed--   | example       |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
|     0 | 1 ft/s      | 5 ft/rd     | average ocean |
|     1 | 2 ft/s      | 10 ft/rd    | average tide  |
|     2 | 4 ft/s      | 20ft/rd     | average river |
|     3 | 6 ft/s      | 30 ft/rd    | fast river    |
|     4 | 8 ft/s      | 40ft/rd     | rapids        |

If the Energy Wielding Roll succeeds, the Current Force increases or decreases by 1 (shaman's choice). The shaman may only wield a Current power-of any Anima-once per four hours. Its effect gradually manifests within an hour (Energy Wielding CS: 3d6 minutes); and only within 1000 feet of where the shaman makes the test. The modified current last 10 minutes after manifesting.

Precipitation : the shaman attempts to change the day's precipitation. If the Energy Wielding Roll succeeds, one additional d10 Precipitation Roll is made for the day (page 144). The shaman's player picks which of the two results applies. The shaman may only wield a Precipitation power-of any Anima-once per day. Its effect manifests over the next d4 hours (Energy Wielding CS: 3d6 minutes); and only applies out to ten leagues from where the shaman wields the energy.

## anima ii

Current : as for Anima I (Current), except it manifests within 3d6 minutes (Energy Wielding CS: 3d6 rounds).

Precipitation : as for Anima I (Precipitation), except that two additional dice are rolled, and the player selects the desired result from among the three.

## anima iii

Current : as for Anima I (Current), except it manifests within 3d6 rounds (Energy Wielding CS: d6 rounds).

Precipitation : as for Anima I (Precipitation), except that three additional dice are rolled, and the player selects the desired result from among the four.
