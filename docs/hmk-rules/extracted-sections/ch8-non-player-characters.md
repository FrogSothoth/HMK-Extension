## quick npc example

The GM's campaign is centred around a rural inn. One PC is the master ostler associated with it; the other PC is an itinerant mercantyler who lives there. The GM decides to generate the innkeeper, deemed a prominent figure, as a Quick NPC.

The NPC is mature and has the Innkeeper occupation (page 42). The GM selects five major skills: Brewing, Melee, Guile, Intrigue, and Cookery.

Brewing SM4 : SM4 from Innkeeper table.

Melee SM2 : SM2 from Skills List table.

Guile SM5 : SM2 from Innkeeper table plus SM3 from Skills List table.

Intrigue SM5 : SM2 from Innkeeper table plus SM3 from Skills List table.

Cookery SM4 : SM2 from Innkeeper table plus SM2 from Skills List table.

The GM generates Brewing ML on the Major Skills table (above). As part of the Lore Group, (continued at top of next page sidebar)

## Non-Player Characters

In addition to drafting compelling encounters, GMs portray the nonplayer characters (NPCs) that the PCs meet throughout their adventures. This section describes three approaches GMs may take to generate the characteristics of NPCs, and offers advice on when best to employ each one.

## Full NPC

Gamemasters may create significant NPCs by following the full routine in Chapter 2: Character . Their Attributes are usually rolled or selected with one fewer d6 (page 38 sidebar), but they can be made elite by using the PC dice arrays.

Advice : while generating a Full NPC can be the best way to learn the character rules, GMs should retain this level of detail for major characters, such as a recurring ally or a principal villain. Spending such time on every single NPC can be daunting, even when simply selecting precise scores rather than randomly generating them.

## Quick NPC

Important personae can be generated more readily, and to a level of ability similar to Full NPCs, by slightly glossing over the creation process. To generate such Quick NPCs, GMs follow the special steps below. Refer primarily to the Occupations (pages 42-44) and Skills List (page 46) tables in Chapter 2. This routine creates humans -the much rarer Elder Folk should be made as Full NPCs.

[�] Background : designate the NPC's age group-young, mature, or old-and family details, such as birth realm and social class.

[�] Occupation : select the NPC's occupation.

[�] Major Skill SM : choose five separate skills that reflect the NPC's core ability. Most of these should come from the table corresponding to the selected occupation, but they can also be any skill of at least SM1 in the Skills List table.

For each skill, make note of its SM given in either the Occupation table or the Skills List table. If it has SM in both tables, add the two together. Ignore the usual concept of Development Points (DP)-they are not used to generate Quick NPCs .

[�] Major Skill ML : calculate ML for these five skills by comparing their SM to the character's age group on the Major Skill table in the sidebar. If the skill belongs to the Combat, Craft, or Physical Group, refer to the physical row of the given SM on this table. For all other skills, refer to the mental row underneath.

Exception : Initiative and Awareness are treated as mental skills.

Each major skill ML equals the listed base amount plus the result of the given dice roll. For instance, a major physical skill with SM4 for a young character has ML equal to 45 + 5d6.

<!-- image -->

Subskills : Shock and Dodge use the SM of Initiative and Melee, respectively, but generate their own separate ML dice rolls, whether as major skills (here) or minor skills (steps 5 and 6).

Languages &amp; Scripts : base Native Language SM is determined according to the table at the bottom of the page 47 sidebar. If selected as a major Skill, each Native Language amount in the character's Occupation table, if any, improves the rolled major ML by d6 more.

Script and Foreign language SM may be selected as major skills with any given, respective amounts in the Occupation table, or with Bonus Language Points (page 48 sidebar). Increase these SM by the appropriate Foreign Language Boosts (same sidebar).

[�] Minor Skill SM : Quick NPCs receive additional skills from several sources-note the SM of such minor skills as follows.

Minor Occupation : record each skill from the NPC's Occupation table that was not selected as a major skill. The SM equals its listed amount there plus any SM also given in the Skills List table.

Languages &amp; Scripts : follow the procedure in step 4 to determine language (native and foreign) and script SMs, except as minor skills.

Encounter Skills : make note of the following skills crucial to resolving most encounters: Initiative, Shock, Melee, Dodge, Awareness, Stealth, Spirit, and one preferred Persuasion skill (Charm, Command, Discourse, Guile, Theatrics). Some of these might have its SM as a major skill. For others, the SM comes from being a Minor Occupation skill (above), or, otherwise, from simply the SM in the Skills List table.

[�] Minor Skill ML : generate an ML for each minor skill using its SM but refer instead to the Minor Skill table in the page 410 sidebar.

Automatic Skills skill with at least SM1 on the Skills List table as a minor skill.

noted in step 5. Use the method as explained for major skills in step 4, : if desired for the NPC, compute the ML of any other

[�] Arcane Talents : decide if the NPC has Arcane Talents other than Spirit, and how many (page 40). Each has an SM according to age: young (SM3), mature (SM4), old (SM5). If the NPC has an arcane 'vocation' (in the GM's estimation), then roll each talent's ML as extra major skills (step 4); otherwise, roll their MLs as minor skills (step 6).

Spirit may be selected as a major skill in step 3; otherwise, roll for its ML by age (as above), or as a minor skill if it is the NPC's only talent.

[�] Skill Bonus : select two separate skills, one of which must be a major skill, and raise each ML by 10.

[�] Attributes : assign scores for the twelve Attributes. The six Physical should be in the following range, by age: young (10-15), mature (8-13), old (6-11). The six Mental should be in the 8-13 range, regardless of age. Attribute Bonus : increase by two the score of two separate Attributes that are in the Skill Base (SB) of the skills chosen for the Skill Bonus (step 8).

Advice : the Quick NPC method can readily generate important allies and enemies in place of the Full approach. GMs can also simply assign precise skill MLs from within the possible dice roll results to reflect best their intended niche, and attribute scores can be further nudged to reflect more satisfyingly skill ML results. To gauge appropriate occupation ML (for any type of NPC), see the Professional ML section on the next page and the accompanying Skill Star Rating sidebar table.

Brewing is a mental skill, so the mature age calls for 40 + 5d6. A roll of 18 produces ML58.

For Melee SM2, a physical skill, 30 is added to 3d6-a 14 gives ML44. The remaining three major skills are generated similarly on the Major Skills table: Guile (45 + 5d6 = ML61), Intrigue (45 + 5d6 = ML70), Cookery (40 + 5d6 = ML62).

The GM now identifies minor skill SM. The innkeeper has Hârnic Native Language SM4 (from guilded parents), and Languages 2 and Script 2 from occupation. Both language SM go to Jarin, giving it SM4 when Foreign Language boosts are included. Lakise SM2 is chosen for the script.

For Encounter Skills SM, Melee was already generated as a major skill, thus making its subskill Dodge an SM2 major skill. All the rest are minor skills: Initiative and Shock (SM3), Awareness (SM3), Spirit (SM3), Stealth (SM3), and Charm (SM3). The GM decides to roll for Charm ML even though the innkeeper already has Guile as a major skill.

The GM could generate as a minor skill any that has an SM in the Skills List table (such as Swimming SM1 or Dancing SM2), but decides none of these are really necessary for the innkeeper.

All minor skill MLs are now determined on the Minor Skill ML table. For instance, native Hârnic ML equals 30 + 3d6 (minor, SM4, mental, mature); Shock is 20 + 3d6 (minor, SM3, physical, mature).

The GM selects Guile and Shock for the Primary Skill +10 bonuses. After generating all the minor skills, and selecting Attributes (and +2 increases), the Quick NPC has the following basic characteristics:

| str 12                    | end12                     | dex 13     |   agl 10 | per 10     | cml 8      |

| aur 8 wil 12 Awareness 32 | aur 8 wil 12 Awareness 32 | Charm      |       31 | Brewing 58 | Brewing 58 |
| Initiative 30             | Initiative 30             | Guile      |       71 | Cookery    | 62         |
| Shock 42                  | Shock 42                  | Intrigue   |       70 |            |            |
| Melee 44 Dodge            | 39                        | Hârnic     |       47 |            |            |
| Spirit 27                 | Spirit 27                 | Jarin      |       40 |            |            |
| Stealth 28                | Stealth 28                | Lakise Sc. |       22 |            |            |

## other quick npc details

The GM assigns other characteristics as desired-Morality, personality traits, appearance, stature. Weapons and gear, and their associated data such as impact and encumbrance, are selected according to estimated wealth (page 52). Simply choosing one of the twelve Armour Suits greatly expedites preparing the NPC.

For Shek-Pvar and Priests, refer to the respective sections of character generation (pages 54-55). While Quick NPC arcanists are certainly possible, there is no easy way around spell selection. Since Ritual remains a minor SM1 skill for most NPCs, assume its likely +2 Blessing EML bonus is already reflected in the associated skill ML results.

## skill star rating

| d100   | stars   | ml    | random   | competence   |

Example : the PCs are at the court of a duchess whom the GM had not designed as a major figure in the campaign. They have gained audience to convince her to grant them passage to an unpopulated island within her coastal realm. The GM gives her a shrewd Intrigue ML70 should it come to her judging any PC tricks (Guile).

## action mastery level

## ml action npc category

- 30 Commoner : a non-combatant because of background	( scholar ),	age	( elderly farmer ), or training ( ill-prepared militia member ).
- 40 Militia : a	non-professional	combatant,	such as	militia	member,	undisciplined	thug	or brigand,	or	inexperienced	mercenary.
- 50 Man-at-arms : a	professional	soldier,	such as	a	feudal	man-at-arms,	legionnaire, mercenary,	or	experienced	thug	or	brigand.
- 60 Veteran : a	well-trained	fighter,	such	as	a feudal	serjeant-at-arms,	squire,	mercenary leader,	or	typical	gladiator.
- 70 Leader : a	full-time	master	soldier,	such	as	a feudal	knight,	mercenary	warband	captain, or	experienced	gladiator	.

If	desired,	modify	the	ML	of	each	category	by	±10 ML	to	reflect	outliersthe sickly scholar (ML20) or the mighty knight (ML80).

Example : while the PCs are exploring a wilderness island, the Trekking Routine calls for an encounter. The GM conjures up in the moment an ambush by a ragged, half-starved group of three shipwrecked mariners (Action ML40) and their savvy, violent first mate (Action ML50). All carry clubs and shortswords and wear the (tattered) Clothing suit.

## attribute mastery level

## ml attribute category (and score)

- 40 Lesser (8) :	a	weakness	of	the	NPC,	such	as a	non-combatant's	physical	attributes,	or some mental ones of the uneducated.
- 50 Typical (10) : the default  physical	and mental	attribute	score	of	nearly	every commoner,	militia,	and	man-at-arms.
- 60 Greater (12) : physical	attributes	of	leaders and	veteran	fighters,	or	certain	mental ones	of	scholarly	or	social	characters.

## Action NPC

The easiest way to introduce an NPC requires no actual preparation before the game session. Given the unifying mechanic of Mastery Level, GMs may simply assign the NPC's skill and attribute ML when called for as the game progresses. Such characters are called Action NPCs because they usually only arise in the moment-or action-at hand. They can be incidental ( the labourer questioned about the missing master mason ), as well as prominent or powerful ( the duchess met at court ).

Advice : GMs should aspire to frequent, even default, use of Action NPCs. The method not only lessens their work load, but its spontaneity expresses one of the joys of gamemastering-fluidly and creatively facilitating the shared, open-ended narrative for the players.

## professional ml

When determining a proper ML for one or two core professional skills of an Action NPC, consult the Occupations tables (pages 42-44) and the Skill Star Rating table (sidebar). While a three-star rating seems average, such competence actually reflects a mature or old master crafter or professional (the 'boss'). Journeymen are typically young with ML6069, and teenage apprentices usually have ML40-59.

Secondary Skills : should the encounter call for NPCs to test something other than their core professional skill, simply select ML between 30 and 59, with the lower ML reflecting tasks further from their specialty. As an alternate quick gauge of automatic skills, ML equals SM×10.

## action ml

When adjudicating combat encounters with Action NPCs, GMs utilise a single Action ML for four principal skills-Initiative, Shock, Melee, and Dodge. The Action Mastery Level table in the sidebar divides NPCs into five general categories as a guide in choosing the proper Action ML for the given NPC. Whenever the NPC attempts a combative task, simply test this ML. Some specialists might require slight amendment ( an Action ML40 scout with Archery ML60 ).

NPC Blocks : the generic human occupations given in the Bestiary (pages 363-365) are examples of Action NPCs. While each includes extra notes about their appearance and personality, GMs can learn to include even this sort of detail on the spur of the moment.

## attribute ml

The GM can select the score and ML of the twelve attributes only as needed, such as for Mishap rolls. The Attribute Mastery Level table in the sidebar suggests defaulting to ML50 (score 10), which also leaves weapon impact modifiers at zero. Only Action ML60 and 70 warrior NPCs might have STR 12 (+1 impact) or perhaps STR 14 (+2 impact).

## npc competence

While the skill breadth of Action NPCs is somewhat truncated, the effectiveness of their ML equals that of Full and Quick NPCs, and even PCs. There are no 'mooks' in HârnMaster-no results of otherwise identical tests produce dramatically worse outcomes for an NPC simply to move the story along or make the PCs seem more heroic. Thus, a PC's Shock ML70 functions identically to an NPC's Shock ML70, whether derived from the Full, Quick, or Action method.
