# Injury Sequence

## injury sequence

Follow	these	five	steps	to	resolve	physical	trauma	inflicted	from	melee,	missile,	and	area	attacks;	falling;	and	certain	esoterica.

## 1 location

Determine	where	a	strike	hits	on	the	target's Body Location table by	rolling	the Zone Die (ZD),	identified	in	the	Missile	or	Melee Sequence,	along	with	the	default d10 Location Die (LD).

Helpless targets :	melee	attackers	who	spend one round concentrating on	a	helpless	target	before	striking select the exact Zone and Location results	instead	of	rolling	in	step	1	(see	Deadly	Attacks,	page	191).

Area Attacks :	a	successful	Area	Fire	or	Frost	attack	does	not	entail Zone	and	Location	Dice	rolls.	The	area	weapon	essentially	engulfs	the entire	body	of	every	target	within	its	dimensions-skip	step	1.

Press &amp; Trip Attacks :	successful	Press	and	Trip	attacks	do	not	include location	or	regular	impact	rolls-skip	steps	1	and	2	(see	page	106).

## body location table

Every	creature	has	a Body Location table	that	displays	its zone numbers (ZN)	spread	over	several	general	body zones with	specific body locations .	Tiny	creatures	like	Vlasta	have	only	3	ZN;	humans	and most	other	folk	have	10	ZN	(see	table,	right);	large	creatures	can	have 12,	16,	20	or	more	ZN.	Some	have	rare	locations,	such	as	tail	or	wing.

## zone die roll

The ZD roll determines the ZN struck	in	the	first	column,	which	in turn	indicates	a	body	zone,	such	as Head , Arms , Torso ,	or Legs .

Zone Aim :	when	both	striker	and	target	are	upright,	medium	size human-like	creatures,	default	aim	is	ZN1	in	the	Head	zone,	so	that	a ZD	roll	of	1	means	ZN1	is	struck,	a	roll	of	2	means	ZN2	and	so	forth. Against	extremely	tall	upright	creatures,	the	default	ZN	is	in	a lower	zone	for	human	strikers,	as	indicated	by	the a symbol	in	the creature's Body Location table	(see	Aklash	example	on	page	352).

Aim Penalty :	melee	strikers	can	aim	for	a	ZN	other	than	the	default, but	a	-10	penalty	applies	to	the	Melee	test	(missile	aiming	does not	include	such	a	penalty).	Striking	a	prone	target	while	standing allows	for	any	default	ZN	with	no	aim	penalty.	Some	ZN	might	not	be available	as	even	possible	for	aiming,	according	to	the	situation.

Zone Reach Penalty : certain ZN of taller targets reduce melee weapon Reach	(RCH),	as	indicated	by	an	amount	inside	the symbol	in	their Body Location table	(see	page	352).	Special	situations	can	also	affect weapon	RCH,	such	as	mounted	combat	(page	172).	If	RCH	is	reduced to less than 0 ,	the	ZN	may	not	be	selected	for	aim.

Zone Die Miss :	if	the	zone	die	result	does	not	appear	in	a	creature's Body Location table,	then	the	strike	misses.	Thus,	aiming	for	ZN8 with a d4 ZD and rolling a 4 against a 10-zone creature results in a	miss	(8	→	9	→	10	→ 11 ).	Larger	attackers	can	similarly	miss	smaller targets,	such	as	the	three-zone	Vlasta	(a	roll	of	4	or	more	misses).

Bonus Zone Dice :	the	Precision	Tactical	Advantage	(page	171)	grants extra	Zone	Dice	of	the	same	size.	Roll	all	the	ZD;	the	player	chooses one	result.	For	each	ZD	over	the	first	that	indicates	the same body zone ('Torso'),	roll	an	additional d10 LD (below)	and	choose	one	LN	result.

## location die roll

The d10 LD result determines the Location Number (LN)	of	the	strike in	the	second	column,	within	the	zone	just	determined	by	the	ZD.	If the	generated	location	is	behind	hard	cover	(page	133),	such	as	a	wall or	tree,	then	the	strike	fails.

Limbs :	when	an	Arm	or	Leg	is	struck,	use	the	ZD	or	LD	result	(or	some other	roll)	to	determine	which		side-odd	(left)	or	even	(right).

## 2 impact

Impact measures the trueness and force with which a blow is delivered.	Determine strike impact and then effective	impact .

## strike impact

Strike	impact	equals	Base	ImpactWeapon Impact Die roll plus Impact Modifier	plus	the	wielder's	Strength	Impact	Modifier (page	97)-plus bonus	Impact	TA	(page	171).

## effective impact

Effective	impact	equals strike impact minus the armour value (AV)	the target	possesses	in	the	location	struck.	The	AV	varies	itself	according to	the	weapon's aspect (Blunt,	Edge,	Point,	or	Fire/Frost).

Area Impact :	the	effective	impact	of	an	Area	attack	equals	its	strike impact	minus	the	target's	Area	AV.

1 Location example : an attacker wielding a broadsword uses a d6	ZD	and	aims	low	at	ZN4	(-10	penalty).	The	strike	succeeds	and so	now	the	d6	ZD	and	d10	LD	are	rolled.	A	ZD	result	of	2	is	modified to zone 5 (aim zone 4 and a roll of 2 results in zone 5): the torso zone.	An	LD	roll	of	7	means	the	strike	specifically	hits	the	abdomen .

2 Impact example : the broadsword strike to the abdomen does d10 + 3 e impact,	and	the	attacker	has	a	+1	Strength	modifier.	A roll of 8 gives strike impact 12 e (8 + 3 + 1 = 12).	The	target	wears	a quilt	coat	with	AV4	in	the	abdomen	versus	edge	aspect.	Effective impact equals 8 e (12 - 4 = 8).

## 3 injury

Locate the effective	impact in the rightmost applicable range in the top row of the following Injury table.	The	strike	inflicts	the injury listed in the corresponding bottom row:

<!-- image -->

## injury severity &amp; level

Injury Severity is Minor (M), Serious (S),	or Grievous (G).	The accompanying	number	is	the Injury Level (IL 1-5).	The	symbols represent	the	chance	for	special	effects:

- Glancing	Blow	(step	3.2).

- Bleeding	(step	3.3).

- Mishap	(step	5).

- Amputation	(step	3.4).

## 3.1 compound injury

Targets	risk	a compound injury if	they	receive	a	new	injury	to	a body location that	already	suffers	from	one	or	more	injuries.	Total	the	IL	of all	the	injuries	in	the	location,	including	the	new	injury.	Roll	a d10 : if the	result	is	less	than	or	equal	to	the	total	IL,	then	increase	the	IL	of the highest-IL injury	in	that	location	by	1.

- If	several	injuries	have	the	same	highest	IL,	then	a	successful compound roll increases the most recent injury's	IL	by	one.
- When	a	G5	injury	compounds,	its	Injury	Level	remains	5,	but	it contributes	Injury	Shock	6	in	step	4.2	(page	169).
- Fire	and	Frost	injuries	compound	only	with	other	Fire	and	Frost injuries	(and	with	each	other).
- Area	injuries	compound	only	with	other	Area	injuries.

Example : a target takes a G4 blunt injury to the shoulder . Because an M1 edge injury already exists in the shoulder, there is a chance for a compound injury.	The	d10	roll	is	against	TN5	(G4	blunt + M1	edge = TN5).	A	roll	of	4 increases the G4 blunt to a G5; the M1 edge remains unchanged.

## 3 Injury example

## injury sequence

## 3.2 glancing blow

Rigid	armour	is	designated	by	a	square	surrounding	its	armour	value in the Armour Value table	(page	111).	The	similar	square	next	to the	M1	injury	result	in	the Injury table	is	a	reminder	to	check	for	a Glancing Blow: E- or P-aspect strikes	with	an	effective	impact	between 1 and 4 against rigid armour do	not	inflict	a	Minor	Injury (M1) but do impart Injury Shock 1 to	the	ensuing	Shock	State	Index	(step	4.2)	and +10	bonus to	the	Shock	Roll	(step	4.3).	Such	Glancing	Blows	do	not require	notation-they	are	not	'injuries'	and	need	no	later	treatment.

## 3.3 bleeding

The three shaded circles in the Body Location table in step 2 indicate possible	life-threatening	blood	loss	in	the	given	location.	Compare	its shaded	circle	with	the	causal	injury's	Severity:

| bleeding   | s3   | g4   | g5   |
|------------|------|------|------|
|            | •    | •    | epb  |
|            | •    | ep   | epb  |
|            | e    | ep   | epb  |

If	the	striking	weapon's	Aspect	is	indicated	from	comparing	the	circle shade	with	the	injury	in	question,	then	the	injury	is	also	a Bleeder (BLD).	The	victim	starts	Blood	Loss	Rolls	(page	178)	in five	minutes .

Example : a target takes a G4 blunt shoulder injury. The shoulder location in step 2 contains a grey circle, but the above table indicates that only E and P aspects cause a Bleeder from a G4	injury . The G4 b injury is not a bleeder.

## 3.4 amputation

A target sustaining a G5 edge injury	in	a	location	containing	a	triangle in the Body Location table	in	step	2	makes	a Strength test	to	check for	amputation.	Apply	a	modifier	according	to	the	triangle's	shade:

+20	(

),	0	(

),	or	-20	(

).

## strength + triangle modifier test

- cf L ocation	severed	(if	neck,	then	target	dies).	Injury	becomes	a	Bleeder	if not	already,	even	in	locations	that	do	not	normally	produce	Bleeders.
- f L ocation	severed	(if	neck,	then	target	dies).	Injury	becomes	a	Bleeder	if not	already,	but	only	in	locations	that	normally	produce	Bleeders.
- s Location	not	severed,	but	Shock	Roll	(step	4.3)	has	a	-20	penalty.
- cs Location	not	severed.
- Beasts	are	assumed	to	have	average	relative	Strength,	so Amputation	rolls	have	ML70	( ),	ML50	( ),	or	ML30	( ).

a

3 Injury example : the target receives a sword strike to the abdomen with effective impact 8 e . Since this is at least 5 impact but less than 10, the blow inflicts an S2 e injury . The target already has an M1 b thorax injury, but there is no Compound Injury roll since this old injury is not in the same location as the new abdomen injury, albeit in the same zone.

## 4 shock

<!-- image -->

Calculate the Shock State Index (SHK)	resulting	from	the	injury.

- 4.1 Location Shock :	start	with	the	number	in	the	black	column	of	the Body Location table	in	step	2	that	corresponds	to	the	injury's location.	Area	Attacks	impart	Location	Shock 6.
- 4.2 Injury Shock :	add	the	Injury	Level	suffered	in	step	3.	If	a Compound	Injury	occurred	in	step	3.1,	then	use	its	IL	instead.

Glancing Blows impart	Injury	Shock 1	but	leave	no	M1	injury.

- 4.3 Shock Roll :	add	the	modifier	from	a Shock test	by	the	target.	The test	includes	Fatigue	penalty	but	not	Injury	impairment. Glancing Blows impart	+10	bonus	to	the	Shock	test.

## shock - fatigue test

- cf +2 shk :	increase	Shock	State	Index	by	two.
- f +1 shk :	increase	Shock	State	Index	by	one.
- s +0 shk : no	modification.
- cs -1 shk : decrease	Shock	State	Index	by	one.

Combine	the	three	SHK	factors	(4.1-4.3)	and	find	the	total	in	the	top row	of	the	following	table.	The	target	suffers	from	the	corresponding Shock State in	the	bottom	row.	SHK 6	or	less	has	no	effect.

inc unc

<!-- image -->

stunned

Target	is	still	aware	but	dazed.	These	effects	apply:

- All	movement	is	Difficult	(and	double	Move	not	allowed).
- Impaired	tests	(step	5)	are	reduced	by	one	Success	Level.
- A successful Shock test	at	the	end	of	the	target's next turn removes	the	stunned	state.	Retry	every	round.
- Suffering	a	new	STN	state	while	currently	stunned immediately	changes	the	shock	state	to	INC.

## incapacitated

Target	is	conscious	but	falls	prone.	These	effects	apply:

- Only	assisted	Difficult	Half	Move	is	allowed.
- No	independent	actions	are	allowed.
- Unaware	(must	Ignore	all	melee	attacks).
- Shock Reroll (right)	at	the	end	of	the	target's next turn .
- Suffering	a	new	INC	state	while	currently	incapacitated immediately	changes	the	shock	state	to	UNC.

## unconscious

Target	falls	unconscious	and	prone.	These	effects	apply:

- Unaware	and	no	actions	allowed.
- Helpless	(CS	Ignore	result	when	targeted	in	melee).
- Shock	Reroll	(right)	after ten minutes .

## killed in action

- Target	immediately	dies.

Except where noted, only the most severe Shock State applies at one time.

## injury sequence

## concentration

All	Shock	States	interrupt	concentration	(page	182),	and	prevent	it until	the	state	is	recovered	from.

## shock reroll

Characters	who	are	Incapacitated	or	Unconscious	make	a Shock Reroll test	of	Shock	ML	with	a -20	penalty .	Shock	Rerolls	are	also affected	by	Fatigue	penalty	but	not	Injury	impairment.

- If INC ,	the	test	is	made	at	the	end	of	the	character's next turn after the	original	Shock	Roll.
- If UNC ,	the	test	is	made ten minutes after	the	original	Shock	Roll.

## shock - 20 - fatigue test

- cf C haracter	suffers	Extended	Shock	(page	179)	with	HR4;	if	Unconscious (UNC),	character	also	lapses	into	a	coma	(page	179).
- f C haracter	suffers	Extended	Shock	(page	179)	with	HR5.
- s Character's	Shock	State	changes	to	Stunned	(STN).
- cs Character's	Shock	State	is	removed.

4 Shock example : the target makes a Shock Roll from the S2 e injury to the abdomen. Against Shock ML65, the d100 roll is 75-critical failure (CF). This results in SHK 8 (Location 4 + Injury 2 + Shock	Roll 2).	The	target	falls	prone, incapacitated (INC). See step 5 for additional effects.

While incapacitated, the character takes no action and Ignores attacks. Then, at the end of the character's next turn, a Shock Reroll is	made	versus	Shock	ML65	with	a	-20	penalty	(EML45). The d100 roll is 42-success (S). The character improves to stunned (STN), though remains still prone.

Until	the	end	of	yet	another	turn,	the	stunned	character	suffers one lower Success Level to all Impaired tests (this excludes Shock Rolls-see step 5 for what constitutes such a test). This character survives	until	that	turn,	takes	a	difficult	Move	to	stand	(costing	20 feet), and then makes a Shock Roll versus Shock ML65 . The d100 roll	is	61,	so	the	character	is	no	longer	Stunned	but	still	suffers impairment from the S2 e abdomen injury (see next page).

## 4 Shock example

## 5 injury effect

The	specific	effect	injuries	have	on	actions	and	movement	varies according	to	severity-Minor	(M),	Serious	(S),	or	Grievous	(G).

- m Associated actions are unhindered if	the	Shock	Roll	in	step 4	succeeded	(S	or	CS).	After	10	minutes-or	immediately	if the	Shock	Roll	failed-the	injury	imparts 5 impairment .
- s Associated	actions	suffer 10 impairment .
- g Associated actions are prohibited .

## impaired actions and movement

Injuries	affect	only	the	actions	and	movement	associated	with	the injured	location's body zone :

| zone     | actions affected byinjury        |                                   |
|----------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| head arm | impairedtests&movement           |                                   |
|          | armimpaired tests (right orleft) | See Impaired Tests in             |
| torso    | impairedtests&movement           | the sidebar for further guidance. |
| legs     | legimpairedtests&movement        |                                   |

Example 1 : a right	shoulder	injury affects	only	right-arm	actions,	such as	striking	with	a	sword,	or	using	it	in	a	Strength	or	Fumble	test.	The	effect varies	by	severity:	Minor	(0	or	-5	impairment);	Serious	(-10	impairment); Grievous	(unusable).	Left	arm	actions	and	movement	are	unaffected.

Example 2 : a left	thigh	injury affects	actions	using	the	legs	and	movement. This	includes	Melee	tests,	since	Melee	SB	includes	Agility	(AGL).	The	effect varies	by	severity:	Minor	(0	or	-5	impairment);	Serious	(-10	impairment); Grievous (unusable; the victim falls prone-see Injury Mishap, below).

## injury mishap

Targets	might	suffer	a	Mishap	Roll	from	Serious	and	Grievous	injuries, or	automatically	suffer	a	failed	one	according	to	the	zone	struck.

| zone   | serious injury             | grievous injury         |
|--------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| head   | none                       | automaticfumble&stumble |
| arm    | fumble roll                | automatic fumble        |
| torso  | stumble roll (pelvis only) | automatic stumble       |
| legs   | stumble roll               | automatic stumble       |

## tests with grievous injury

A character forced into melee defence with a zone that is unusable because of Grievous injury must either choose the Ignore defence or accept	an	automatic	CF	in	a	Block,	Dodge,	or	Counterstrike	test	(the	CF also	induces	the	automatically	failed	Mishap	detailed	above).	Against missile	attacks,	such	an	injured	target	is	considered Still .	Attempting any	other	action	that	requires	using	a	zone	with	a	Grievous	injury-or is	otherwise	unusable-is	an	automatic	CF.

## area injuries

Area	injuries	affect	all	impaired	tests	and	movement.	Grievous	area injuries	induce	and	affect	mishaps	like	the	head	zone.

## projectile impalement

Arrows	and	crossbow	bolts	that	inflict	at	least	an	S3	injury	are impaled	and	require	the	Extraction	treatment	(page	180).

a

a

## minor injury

The	immediate	effect	of	adrenaline	very	often	defers	Minor injuries	from	impairing	performance	for	about	10	minutes.	Even at	this	point,	only	un-	or	ill-treated	Minor	injuries	carry	this impairment	throughout	the	healing	process	(see	page	182).

## serious injury

Serious	injuries	are	not	so	structurally	devastating	as	to	prevent their	use,	but	they	do	impart	immediate	impairment.	A	single Serious	injury	can	also	test	the	grit	of	even	the	well-trained-they must	make	a	Morale	Roll	to	continue	(page	162).

## grievous injury

Grievous	injuries	imply	such	extensive	structural	damage	that the	location	is	rendered	immediately	unusable.	No	amount	of grit	mitigates	this	loss	of	function.	Moreover,	if	the	victim	is	able to	remain	conscious	after	a	Grievous	injury,	their	fighting	spirit	is challenged-they	must	test	Morale	to	continue	(page	162).

## impaired tests

Impaired	effects	apply	to	the	following	skill	and	attribute	tests when	the	injury	is	in	the	given	Body	Zone	(⚫).	Such Impaired tests also	suffer	-1	Success	Level	when	performed	while	Stunned	(page 169).	For	how	trauma	affects	esoterica,	see	the	pertinent	routines, such	as	Spellcasting	(page	201)	or	Talent	Invocation	(page	259).

## initiative and shock

Initiative	and	Shock	tests	reflect	in	part	a	boost	of	adrenaline	that can	mitigate	the	effects	of	trauma.	Although	Combat	Group	skills, neither	are	considered	Impaired	tests	for	the	purposes	of	injury	and Shock	State	effects.	Only	these	modifiers	affect	their	tests:

- Fatigue	penalty.
- Glancing	blow	+10	bonus	(Shock	only).
- Shock	Reroll	-20	penalty	(Shock	only).
- Modifiers	resulting	from	a	change	to	their	skill	base	attributesWill	and	Reasoning	(Initiative);	Strength	and	Endurance	(Shock).

5 Injury Effect example : the target who received the S2 abdomen injury in the step 4 example has fought through the pain of being Incapacitated and then Stunned. The character is	now	conscious	but	suffers 10 impairment to the torso zone, which penalises many Impaired tests and Move.

Serious	injuries	trigger	a	Morale	Roll	after	recovering	from being Stunned. This combatant has an Initiative ML60-a roll of 29 is Success, so the warrior remains steady.

## Special Melee Rules

This section details several important elements of combat-Tactical Advantages, being prone, and mounted combat. See the sidebars for additional rules, such as getting In Close and the free Press Roll.

## tactical advantages

Exceptional missile and melee tests can result in four types of Tactical Advantages (TA): Action , Impact , Precision , and Setup . Unless noted otherwise, combatants receiving more than one TA at the same time may combine TA of different types and/or multiples of the same type.

Action : the character takes an immediate action, limited to six options:

| • melee attack (readiedweapononly) *   | • grope                        |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| • evade (halfmovemaximum)              | • pass †                       |
| • move (halfmovemaximum)               | • get in close † (see sidebar) |

*Targets	of	this	TA	attack	may	only	Dodge	or	Ignore.

†May	first	include	5-foot	move.

The same character may choose only one Action TA per round (but see TwoWeapon fighting in the sidebar), and only one Action TA by anyone may occur per character turn . Thus, several bonus Actions can happen during the same round by various attackers and defenders, but they all would have to be earned by different characters on different turns.

Impact : each Impact TA increases strike impact according to the Aspect used: 3 b , 5 e , 4 p , 2 f are the defaults. Weapons that increase it by a different amount note it with the impact ta trait (page 98).

Precision : each Precision TA grants one additional Zone Die roll; the player selects which result to apply. For each ZD over the first that indicates the same body zone (Head or Torso, for example), an additional d10 LD is rolled, with the player choosing which LN result to apply.

Setup : each Setup TA improves a Melee or Dodge test made within the next round by one success level. A setup can represent a parry or feint that establishes a more effective follow-up strike or dodge.

Characters do not have to announce beforehand the action to which setups will be applied-they simply hold and use them as desired. Setups do not have to apply to the next test the character makes, and several setups could be spread over separate tests. Characters lose a setup if not used within one round of the IR after it was earned. Thus, a setup earned on IR70 must be used before or on IR70 of the next round.

## prone

The following effects apply to prone combatants:

- A moving opponent does not have to stop in their Engagement Zone.
- A standing melee striker may select any of their ZN for default aiming without the -10 penalty, and may also get In Close automatically.
- They do not contribute to an opponent's Outnumbered Penalty.
- Their own melee attacks and defences have -20 penalty.
- They have default Aim ZN2-3, and -2 RCH with ZN1, against standing, human-sized foes (apply similar shifts with larger, standing foes).
- Crawling is Difficult Movement with a full Move maximum rate.
- Rising requires the Move action and costs ten feet of movement.

## two-weapon fighting

A combatant wielding an off-hand weapon of at least Length 2 may earn two Melee Attack Action TA in the same round, one selected with the primary weapon and one with the off-hand.

## in close

The combatant with the longer weapon Reach initially has the advantage when engaged. An aware combatant within five feet of a foe may reverse this advantage by choosing to get In Close with a target in three possible ways:

- Freely against a prone, confused, stunned, unaware, or helpless foe.
- Freely after a successful Grab.
- By using an Action TA (see table, left).

The following rules apply when an engagement between two combatants becomes In Close:

- Reach Penalty goes to the one striking with a weapon that has a longer weapon Reach. Penalty equals RCH difference × 5 .
- Thrust Bonus goes to the one striking with a Thrust weapon that has a shorter weapon Reach. Bonus equals RCH difference × 5 .

Characters stay In Close until one of them ends it by taking any movement to get at least five feet away from the given opponent.

Tight Quarters: GMs can deem combatants in limited space automatically In Close with each other while they are confined. For using certain weapons in awkward spaces ( swinging a battle sword in a narrow passage ), GMs can apply a -20 penalty or simply disallow it. Thrusted weapons often avoid such restrictions.

## natural weapons

Combatants using natural weapons against opponents with armed weapons are at a disadvantage both offensively and defensively.

Natural Strike versus armed Block: armed defenders who roll at least a one-star victory may automatically strike their attacker in the natural weapon's body zone (roll d10 for LN). A success tie is still a block, a 'warding' of the strike without the weapon making contact.

Armed Strike versus natural Defence: most unarmed defenders-especially beastsCounterstrike or Dodge. Many can attempt a Limb Block (page 106), but risk injury to the limb, even in a successful 'block'. Some may also try a Counterstrike Grab (Hold) in defence.

## prone beasts

Creatures who do not walk, such as snakes and serpentine Ivashu, do not become 'prone'.

## mounted examples

Example 1 : a knight with Riding ML65 atop a destrier with Initiative ML60 has Control Roll  70 (ML65 plus 5 Secondary Modifier from the mount's Initiative). There is no Mounted Penalty to their missile and melee tests because the Secondary Modifier of the knight's Riding ML65 is +5.

Example 2 : a farmer with Riding ML26 atop the same horse as above has Control Roll  31 (ML26 plus 5). The Mounted Penalty to their missile and melee tests is -15, the negative Secondary Modifier of the farmer's Riding ML26.

## free press roll

Warriors clutch and jostle one another often in melee. To reflect this dynamic, combatants may call for a free Press Roll any time they successfully test Melee and also achieve a higher success level without benefit of a tiebreak . The Press Roll is in addition to the Melee test result and is made after applying the effects of injuries and mishaps but before Action TA. This free option skips the Press Attack and goes straight to the opposed d6 + STR Press Roll (page 106).

The free Press Roll option is not awarded to combatants making an actual Press Attack, whether as Strike or Counterstrike; nor to defenders selecting the Dodge defence in the Melee test. The STR of a mount that is under Control may be used in a Press Roll resulting from the rider's own Melee test. Finally, larger combatants might receive Free Press rolls more easily (see Mighty Strike, page 353).

Example 1 : an ML60 attacker strikes with a sword and rolls 41 (S) against an ML75 blocking defender who rolls 82 (F). The sword strike succeeds and the attacker resolves the injury. The attacker may then call for a free Press Roll.

Example 2 : an ML60 striking attacker rolls 41 (S) against an ML75 blocking defender who rolls 65 (CS) . The block succeeds and the defender may call for a free Press Roll.

Example 3 : an ML60 attacker rolls 41 (S) against an ML75 blocking defender who rolls 66 (S). The block succeeds because blocks automatically win tied successes. However, there is no free Press roll option since neither combatant achieved a higher success level without a tiebreak.

## attacks during chases

During a pursuit, when attackers catch up or maintain engagement with the pursued using a full or double Move, the pursuer can make an attack with -20 penalty after the Move action. Defence options other than Dodge also have -20 penalty. If conditions are not ideal, the GM might require each party to make a Stumble Roll before the opposed 'chase' Melee test.

## mounted combat

The advantage a mounted warrior has depends largely on the combined training of the rider and animal. This is first measured by a Control Roll that equals the rider's Riding ML adjusted by the mount's Initiative Secondary Modifier (page 62). Second, both rider and mount have missile and melee Attack and Defence tests adjusted by the rider's Riding Secondary Modifier if it is negative -this is called the Mounted Penalty .

Mounting : to mount or dismount, the rider takes a Move action and expends ten feet of movement. If the mount is moving or agitated, the rider must also succeed on a Control Roll. If it fails with a moving mount, the rider suffers a six-foot leap (see Falling Routine, page 67).

Encumbrance : riders improve their ENC modifier by -15 (page 112).

Initiative Rank : rider and mount each take an Action on the rider's IR.

## Mounted Movement

At the start of their turn, riders may make a Control Roll as a free action (with failure, the rider may retest Control as a 1-turn Grope action). With success, the rider Controls the mount and must declare the intended move distance , which can first include one rate change (Stop ← ← Half ← ← Full ← ← Double). Uncontrolled mounts usually repeat their previous action.

Minimum Movement : mounts must move the declared distance during the turn or suffer an automatically failed Stumble roll (page 354).

Turns : mounts can turn 45° after moving an amount equal to the full declared distance divided by the rider's Control Index (rounded off).

## Mounted Melee

On the shared IR, the mount takes an Action, either directed by a rider in Control or chosen by the GM. The rider may also take an Action at any point if the Control Roll did not expend it. Mount and rider count as two allies for the Outnumbered rule. See page 355 for mount attack types.

Ride-by attacks : riders may attack at any point during their mount's movement, but the mount's own attacks are subject to the moving restrictions of its own action (page 161). For how enemy EZ can stop movement , refer only to the mount-and see Overruns (page 353).

Rider Impact bonus : melee strikes by riders receive their mount's Rider Impact bonus (page 354) throughout the turn and ensuing round when the mount moves straight 100+ feet (or half the bonus for 50+ feet).

Unmounted targets : riders have -1 RCH to strikes not aimed at ZN1 of unmounted, human-sized targets.

Unmounted defenders : on the same turn, defenders may Block or Counterstrike either the rider's or mount's attack-and must Dodge the other. Defenders have -1 RCH to aim counterstrikes at the rider's ZN1.

## mounted defence

Rider targets : riders have -20 penalty to Dodge and -10 penalty to Block or Counterstrike (even against other riders); unmounted foes have -1 RCH to aim strikes at the rider's ZN1.

Mount targets : mounts may Dodge; or, with Control, riders may command mounts to Counterstrike; or riders with -20 penalty may Block or Counterstrike attacks targeting their mounts.
