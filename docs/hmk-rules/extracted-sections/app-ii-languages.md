# Appendix II: Languages

## appendix ii: languages

The Venârivè: Languages map	on	page	426	shows	where	each	language	predominates.	Its colour-coding	corresponds	to	the	tables	in	the	sidebars	of	pages	424-425,	which	list	the	modern languages	and	scripts	of	each	family.	Refer	to	these	tables	to	determine	whether	a	character receives	the	Foreign	Language	boost	(page	48	sidebar).

## mutual intelligibility

As	explained	in	the	Language	skill	entry	(page	77),	the	maximum	complexity	of	a	conversation	is defined	by	the	lesser	speaker's	Index	in	the	shared	tongue:	0-2	( limited ),	3-5	( basic ),	6-7	( advanced ), 8+ ( profound ).	Conversation	between	those	of	widely	divergent	dialects-and	even	closely	related, but	different,	languages-can	also	allow	for	some	level	of mutual intelligibility .

Languages	allowing	for	such	understanding	are	noted	by	a	superscript	letter	next	to	their	names in the sidebar Family tables.	Each	is	assigned	a	rating	between	M1	and	M4	in	the	corresponding lettered	keys	below	and	on	the	next	page.	For	establishing	a	conversation's	complexity,	the Language	Index	of	both	speakers	is	simply	reduced	by	this	M	rating	(sometimes	this	can	be asymmetrical).	If	either	party's	Language	Index	is	reduced	to	less	than	0,	then	no	understanding	is possible.	Characters	may	also	make	an	actual	test	in	the	related	language	by	reducing	the Mastery Level (ML)	in	their	own	language	by	an	amount	equal	to	the	M-rating	×10.

## m mutual intelligibility description

0 close dialects: many	language	dialects	have	no	M	rating	with	each	other.	Problems	from differing	accents	or	lexicon	do	not	regularly	arise	enough	to	affect	mutual	understanding. Assume	this	as	the	default	for	most	dialects	of	a	language	unless	otherwise	noted.

1-2 distant dialects: some	dialects	are	so	distinct,	usually	the	result	of	disparate	geography, that	the	two	respective	speakers	face	an	M1	or	M2	reduction	to	effective	Language	Index.

3-4 similar languages: some	dialects	are	so	distinct	as	to	appear	more	as	similar	languages, allowing	respective	speakers	to	achieve	only	very	limited	mutual	comprehension.

A Thonian	consists	of	six	dialects	of	varying degrees	of	mutual	intelligibility	( inner , laker , mountain , northern , southern ,	and western ).

|      | inn   | lak   | mou   | nor   | sou   | wes*   |
|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| inn  | -     | m2    | m1    | m2    | m3    | m2     |
| lak  | m2    | -     | m1    | m1    | m3    | m2     |
| mou  | m1    | m1    | -     | m1    | m3    | m2     |
| nor  | m2    | m1    | m1    | -     | m3    | m1     |
| sou  | m3    | m3    | m3    | m3    | m�-2† | m3     |
| wes* | m4    | m4    | m4    | m3    | m4    | -      |

* Western	Thonian	has	developed	into	an	M4	creole	with the Falani of coastal colonisers (although Falani speakers are	themselves	M2	to	understand	Western	Thonian). † Southern Thonian has M0 to M2 intelligibility with variations of itself , according to the distance isolated tribal groups are from each other.

B The three Tuvaran dialects ( eastern , southern , western )	are	largely	mutually	intelligible	(M2).

C Nasik	Azeri	(low	Azeryani)	has	four	core dialects ( eastern , island , prime ,	and southern ). All	have	M2	intelligibility	with	each	other	(and occasionally	even	M1	internally).

Eight	'new'	dialects	of	Nasik	Azeri	( central , northern , western , Terazin , Lankori , Kolvisar , Dalazeri , Gorik )	are	M1	with	each	other	and prime ,	but	M2	with	the	other	three	core dialects.	A	ninth	'new'	one, Byrian ,	is	M2	with all	other	Nasik	Azeryani	dialects.

Zakimladal	(high	Azeryani)	is	spoken	by	the imperial	nobility	and	bureaucrats	throughout the	Azeryan	Region.	Its	complexity	and	style make	it	M3	with	Nasik	Azeri	dialects;	its prestige	has	kept	divergent	dialects	of	its	own from	significantly	developing.

D Karejian	dialectology	is	very	complex.	Until it	is	completely	surveyed,	a	simple	rule	is	that each	city-state	has	its	own	dialect,	M1	with every	other	one.	All	are	M4	with	Elbythian.

E Altic ( eastern and western )	are	M2	with	each other; western Altic	is	M4	with	Yarla.

F Emelan	is	M1	with	the	tribal	Emhlen,	as are	the	Emhlen	dialects	of	the	five	Emhle subtribes	with	each	other.

G The	Jarin	spoken	in	Orbaal,	Azadmere, and	Evael	have	M3	with	each	other	(because of	their	long	isolation)	and	M4	with	the	Jarin tribal	dialects.	Separate	Jarin	tribal	dialects have	M3	with	each	other.

H Yarili	and	Yarla	are	M3	with	each	other; Yarla	is	M4	with	Alticwestern .

I Anil	Ketari	and	Ketari	are	M3	with	each other	and	both	M4	with	Reksyni.

J Hacherian is a diverging dialect of Besha; they	have	M2	intelligibility.

K Ivinian	dialects	have	multiplied	rapidly as the consequence of far-reaching trade and	conquests	throughout	Venarive	( Cheler , Harbaaler , Ivinian , Kantal , Orbaaler , Palithaner ):

|       | che   | har   | ivi   | kan*   | orb †   | pal ‡   |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| che   | -     | m1    | m2    | m2     | m2      | m2      |
| har   | m1    | -     | m2    | m2     | m2      | m2      |
| ivi   | m2    | m2    | -     | m2     | m1      | m2      |

| pal ‡ | m3    | m4    | m3    | m3     | m4      | -       |

* Speakers of the trade pidgin Kantal have a lower intelligibility	of	other	Ivinian	dialects	(usually	M4)	than vice	versa	(M2-M3).	See	also	sidebar	note	(below	right). † Orbaaler is a pidgin spawned by Kantal, heavily influenced	by	Jarin,	and	is	becoming	creolised	(spoken from	birth).	Jarin	speakers	have	M2	with	Orbaaler speakers,	but	Orbaaler	speakers	have	M4	with	Jarin. ‡ Use Palithaner for Tarkainer's relationships; the two have	M1	intelligibility	with	each	other.

L Hârnic	dialects	spoken	in	each	'civilised' realm	are	M1	with	the	others,	and	M3	with tribal Hârnic dialects (but the Pagaelin tribe speak	the	Hârnic	of	feudal	Chybisa).	Hârnic tribal	dialects	are	M2	with	each	other.

## scholarly languages

Below	is	a	partial	list	of	old	languages	and	scripts	that	Venarian	scholars	employ	to	read	historical texts.	Included	is	the	approximate	period	of	use	and	the	salient	historical	importance	(see sidebar	table	on	page	405	for	the	spans	of	the	various	eras).	Modern	Emelan	(in	Lakise	script)	and Zakimladal	(in	Ayaran	script)	are	the current primary	languages	of	international	scholarship.

M Quarphic consists of three contiguous dialects ( western , northern ,	and southern ) and	a	disparate	one	in	the	middle	of	Reksyni ( eastern ).	These	also	share	varying	levels	of understanding	with	Hurisean.

N The ten dialects found on the Venârivè Map publication are described here as three groups (Mo	internally):	coastal	( Melodan , Pelodan , Loalan , Kolaren ),	southern	( Qualren , Fedin ),	and eastern ( Sabes , Enseler , Nistalen , Jandi ).

O The Trierzi Dialect table (page 422) shows 26	dialects.	Those	whose	zones	are	directly adjacent	to	each	other	have	M0	intelligibility; for	each	additional	zone	away,	increase	this	by M1,	up	to	a	maximum	M3.

For	this	purpose,	zone	J	is	adjacent	to	U,	but not	to	P	(M1).	Zone	V	is	not	adjacent	to	I	and	W (M1),	nor	is	zone	O	with	E	and	W	(M1).

## additional language notes

Elder Scripts : Ælrhin write Sinain in Selenian;	the	Kuzhai	employ	Khruni	to write Kuzhan .	It	is	not	known	whether Malakta	and	Nadi	have	unique	scripts.

Kantal :	'Trade	Ivinian'	is	a	pidgin spoken by	seamen	and	shippers	throughout northwestern	Venarive.	Its	simplicity grants	all	learners		a	+1	SM	boost,	in addition	to	the	same-family	foreign language	boost	(page	48	sidebar).

Temple Tongues : the secret language of the Morgathian church is Ormauk , written in an archaic script called Nuvesarl.	The	Agrikan	church	has a	secret	temple	tongue	known	as Surikal .	The	Ilviran	church	has	a	special language called Ivashi employed	by	its priests,	apparently	enabling	them	to communicate	with	Ivashu.

Tonátri :	the	Tonatri	of	the	Azeryan Region	claim	to	pre-date	the	speakers of	Jarind,	Pharic,	and	Azeri	languages; their language does seem unrelated to these	nearby	groups	and	so	does	not appear	on	any	Family	tables.
