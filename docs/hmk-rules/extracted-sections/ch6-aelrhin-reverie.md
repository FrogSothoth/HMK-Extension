# Ælrhin Reverie

## Ælrhin Reverie

The Ælrhin routinely enter a semi-conscious state of contemplation, remaining motionless for minutes, days, or even weeks at a time. During such a reverie -an astral mystery similar to shamanic trance-Ælrhin require no food and water but are otherwise vulnerable to the elements and bodily injury. They also retain at least some awareness of their physical surroundings.

Elven-folk enter reveries to contemplate their deepest connection to Kelestia and rekindle extraordinary abilities. They must be in a quiet place to attain such a state. Hallowed locations deepen the experience, varying according to elven-kind-the Sinai of Hârn prefer secluded groves; the Hwætharwyn of Altor choose snow-tossed dells; the Naeri of Anzeloria seek lofty treetops.

## Reverie

To enter a reverie, the Ælrhin selects one of the five Reverie Types (opposite) and takes the following steps.

[�] Action : there is no cant or gesture, but elves must be conscious before entering the reverie.

[�] Test : at the outset make a Spirit Success Value test.

Sacred Ground : if on Siemist Sacred Ground, include a Secondary Roll against the Ground's Consecration star rating (page 320). A success increases the Spirit SV by 1.

## sv spirit success value test

- ≤ 2 reverie attained : Awareness tests and tests associated with Lifting	the	Veil (page 291) have -20	penalty.
- 3-4 reverie attained .
- 5 1 reverie attained : Awareness tests and tests associated with
- Lifting	the	Veil	have	+5	bonus	per	star.	Each	star	beyond	three 6 2
- also	both	grants	+5	bonus	to	the	five	Spirit	World	Action 7 3
- Spirit tests and extends the maximum duration of an astral 8 4
- journey	by	one	round	(page	294). 9+ 5

[�] Result : Ælrhin never fail to attain the reverie; the roll just determines the modifiers. The reverie is not an astral journey, although those capable of lifting the veil may attempt to do so at any point while in a reverie.

[�] Required Length : the Ælrhin must maintain the reverie for a total number of minutes, hours, or days-according to the Reverie Type-to benefit from its effect at the end.

10 minutes : the Woodcraft and Rejuvenation reveries must last uninterrupted or they must be restarted.

Span : the other three reveries list the required length over a time span ('8 hours over 1 day'). The Ælrhin must enter the reverie for a minimum of 4 hours, may exit it (or have it interrupted), and then may resume it later (making a new Spirit SV upon re-entry). Elves receive the reverie's benefit only upon accumulating the total required length within the given time span. Thus, an elf could enter a Rest Reverie for 4 uninterrupted hours, exit it for 16 hours, and then reenter and complete the last 4 hours, fulfilling the 8 hours of required length just barely within the time span of 1 day.

Anything that breaks concentration (page 182) also ends the reverie. Non-traumatic physical disturbance (shaking) requires a successful Will test to maintain it.

## Reverie Types

Ælrhin select one of the following each time they enter a reverie. Completing it produces the given effects.

Woodcraft (10 minutes): for the next 24 hours, the elf includes a Spirit SR with all Stealth tests versus nonÆlrhin (whether opposed or unopposed). A success increases the Stealth success level by one, even of failures.

Rejuvenation (10 minutes): all fatigue from windedness is removed; fatigue from weariness is reduced by 5.

Rest (8 hours over 1 day): several benefits are gained.

- Double the number of Healing Rolls for five days.
- Immune to infection for five days.
- All current fatigue from weariness removed.
- Optional Lucid Dream roll at end (page 292).

Faeriecraft (20 hours over 5 days): upon entering the Faeriecraft reverie, the elf may begin a craft project (even in the semi-conscious state). At the end of the craft project (even if it takes longer than the reverie), a Spirit SR is included in the Craft Success Value test. A successful SR instills a special trait-see Chapter 3: Skills (page 93).

Blessed Dream (15 days over one 3-month season): Ælrhin who fail to complete a Blessed Dream within the seasonal time span must test Spirit :

## spirit test

- cf -20	penalty	for	the	next	three	months	to	Fate	Rolls,	and	tests of	AUR	and	skills	with	AUR	in	the	SB;	acquire	Psyche	Stress 4 .
- f -10	penalty	for	the	next	three	months	to	the	tests	as	for	CF; acquire a Psyche	Stress 2.
- s -10	penalty	for	the	next	three	months	to	the	tests	as	for	CF.
- cs No	effect.

Sacred Transference : upon completing a Blessed Dream while on Siemist Sacred Ground, Ælrhin may test Spirit as if it were the Transference talent to employ a nearby Barasi Point (page 264). If already possessing the talent, the elf gets a test bonus equal to Spirit Index. The ability for Sacred Transference lasts for the next three months.

Seasons : the time spans of the four individual Blessed Dream reveries every year begin with each new calendar season: 1 Nuzyæl, 1 Nolus, 1 Azura, and 1 Ilvin.
