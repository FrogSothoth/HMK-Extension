# Preparing A Game

## Preparing A Game

Future published world modules will include sample adventures keyed to their locales. The forthcoming Gamemaster's Kit provides a detailed campaign area with fully developed encounters and NPCs, and additional advice and playing aids. When preparing their own unique games, GMs can start by working through the following nine steps.

[�] Scope : will the game be one short session, or several sessions of a more complex adventure? How many players will be involved? The intimacy of Kethira's realistic setting makes even one- and two-player character groups quite enjoyable, and frequently more manageable.

[�] Theme : what aspects of Kethira will the PCs engage? As discussed in the introduction to Chapter 5: Adventure , character exploits often involve influence (political intrigue, character drama, trade), travel (exploration, survival), and combat (warfare, banditry, duels).

[�] Setting : in which area of the world will the campaign take place? Many modules have been published over the setting's 40-year history that detail entire regions, kingdoms, cities, villages and wilderness areas. GMs can even ignore the canon, and remake places as they see fit.

[�] Antagonist : who is the primary foe that the PCs face? While often an individual ( a scheming Amorvrus ), the antagonist could also be an entire group (the Mercantyler's Guild ), a strange creature ( a rampaging Hru ) or even a natural phenomenon ( an earthquake ).

Factions : are there other individuals the PCs might encounter who are allies or rivals to the principal antagonist or to the PCs themselves?

[�] Antagonist Goal : what does the antagonist wish to accomplish? Most importantly, GMs should describe for themselves the sequence of events that would happen were the PCs not involved. This establishes a timeline to which subsequent encounters are linked, often giving the GM a guide to how and when to present the unfolding adventures.

[�] Narrative Seeds : make three broad statements about elements of the forthcoming game, to be shared with players in step 7. These should not telegraph the narrative, and can even be quite cryptic. For instance: The Road to Azadmere , An Important Message , A Gathering Blizzard might be the seeds describing the On The Silver Way Quickstart adventure.

[�] Character Generation : when the players generate their characters, present them with the narrative seeds of step 6. The players might take inspiration from them when designing their characters-but should feel free to ignore them, too ('fish out of water' PCs can be interesting).

PCs First : alternatively, have the players generate their characters before step 4 . The GM then formulates the antagonist based upon the resulting PCs, perhaps tapping into or challenging their various characteristics.

[�] Initial Adventure : even if designing a longer campaign, GMs need not prepare much more than the first series of encounters to begin the game-see the Adventure section on the next page for general tips.

[�] Evolving Campaign : while GMs may certainly map out several interconnected epic adventures, most campaigns naturally evolve after the first adventure. Experienced GMs might not plan at all-such 'sand box' games allow the players to wander and explore as they wish, a classic style of play for which the setting of Kethira is especially suitable.

## campaign time

All setting material published by Kelestia Productions describes Kethira at the start of the first day of the year tr 720 (1 Nuzyæl), counted from the founding of the Kingdom of Melderyn on Hârn in tr 1. Years prior to this are noted as 'before Tuzyn', or bt (starting with bt 1 and numbering back).

Gaming groups then develop the world according to the events of their own campaign. Published adventures that begin on a later date in tr 720 assume that nothing has changed in the setting since 1 Nuzyæl-the 'frozen' start day has simply been moved forward. Any future local events referenced in an adventure are only potential canon-GMs still incorporate as much of it as they wish, very much like adventures they create themselves.

## historical eras

Kethiran scholars refer commonly to several eras. The GM can use the following table to roll the random age of an artefact or written work (the oldest known scripts date back to the dawn of the Codominium). See the Venârivè book for extensive discussion of historical events.

| d100   | era         | years                 |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------|
| 01-75  | Modern      | tr 501 to the present |
| 76-87  | Middle      | bt 300- tr 500        |
| 88-91  | Ancient     | bt 1300- bt 301       |
| 92-95  | Codominium  | bt 7200- bt 1301      |
| 96-97  | Pre-Kúzhan  | bt 10,000- bt 7201    |
| 98     | Lost Years  | bt 15,000- bt 10,001  |
| 99-00  | Earthmaster | bt 20,000- bt 15,001  |

Two other historical terms are also used:

Classical Age ( bt 1000tr 1): measured from the rise of Karuia city-states of the Venarian Sea, to the founding of Melderyn on Hârn.

Ælder Era ( bt 20,000bt 1301): encompasses the entire time from the purported arrival of the Earthmasters on Kethira to the founding of the Codominium on Hârn, the golden age when Sinai and Kuzhai lived harmoniously.

## map scales

Many of the various maps published for the world of Kethira use the following scales:

| typeofmap   | scale                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| Regional    | 1cm=5leagues(20kmor about 12.5 miles) |
| Atlas       | 1cm=5km                               |
| Area        | 1mm=100feet                           |
| Local       | 1mm=10feet                            |
| Interior    | 1mm=1foot                             |
