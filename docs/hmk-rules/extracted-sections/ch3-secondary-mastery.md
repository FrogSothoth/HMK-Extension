# Secondary Mastery

## secondary mastery

Characters only ever test one primary Mastery Level (ML) at a time. However, occasionally, other skills and attributes can indirectly affect the test. Such Secondary Mastery manifests as either a Secondary Modifier or a Secondary Roll .

## Secondary Modifier

A separate skill or attribute can lend a bonus or penalty to the EML of a Success test. Such a Secondary Modifier is derived from the Index of the secondary skill or attribute:

|   index |   modifier | index            |   modifier |
|---------|------------|------------------|------------|
|       0 |        -25 | 6                |         +5 |
|       1 |        -20 | 7                |        +10 |
|       2 |        -15 | 8                |        +15 |
|       3 |        -10 | 9                |        +20 |
|       4 |         -5 | 10               |        +25 |
|       5 |          0 | per Index beyond |         +5 |

Example : a character tests Command ML48 to keep an ally from fleeing a battle. This Rally Roll requires characters to include the Secondary Modifier of their Initiative skill, an indicator of combat experience. The character has an Initiative ML72 (Index 7), which gives a +10 bonus and raises the Command EML to 58.

A Success test might rarely call for more than one Secondary Modifier. In this instance, the sum of all Secondary Modifiers applies to the EML of the test. The tested skill is displayed first, followed by Secondary Modifier skills and attributes in parentheses:

## Alchemy (Herblore • Mineralogy)

In this example, Alchemy establishes the ML of the Success test, with the Secondary Modifiers of both Herblore and Mineralogy affecting Alchemy EML.

In a Success Value test, the SV is based upon the Index of the primary skill's ML, not EML. Secondary Modifiers directly affect the EML, not the SV (see Example, right).

## Secondary Roll

A separate skill or attribute can also lend its Index as the Target Number (TN) in a Secondary Roll (SR). An SR is a d10 roll that generates either Success (the roll is less than or equal to TN) or Failure (greater than TN). There are no 'critical' results. If modified, a TN has no minimum or maximum, so TN0 or less is always a failure, and TN10 or more is always a success.

A Secondary Roll is made alongside a Success or Success Value test. The effect varies by situation: for instance, a successful Endurance SR reduces fatigue accrual by five as part of a Climbing SV test (page 67); a successful SR that accompanies many crafting routines often improves the resulting Success Value by one.

Example : preparing an elixir (page 268) is an Alchemy SV test with both Herblore and Mineralogy Secondary Modifiers, and a Mathematics Secondary Roll:

Alchemy SV (Herblore ∙ Mineralogy ∙ Mathematics SR)

If a character has Alchemy ML82, Herblore ML43, Mineralogy ML54, and Mathematics ML35, then the Success test is against EML77 (ML82 - 5 from Herblore + 0 from Mineralogy); with a Secondary Roll TN3 from Mathematics Index. Notice that the base SV8 is derived from Alchemy ML82, not the EML77. The items within parentheses indicate Secondary Rolls if followed by SR, otherwise, they are Secondary Modifiers.

## Secondary Mastery Requirement

Secondary Mastery is called for sparingly. It most often occurs in long-term craft or research actions, where the effect of several ancillary skills and attributes is folded into a dramatic throw of d100 and d10 at the same time.

If a character does not have Mastery Level in a skill called for as a Secondary Modifier in a test, then the test may not be made, regardless of whether the character has ML in the primary skill. Secondary Modifiers in a test are integral to the endeavour itself, not extra or optional.

This is not the case for Secondary Rolls . The primary Success test may be attempted even without mastery in a skill that is called for as a Secondary Roll-but consider the SR a failure should that determination be required.

## proxy secondary modifier

Sometimes one character may provide the Secondary Modifier used in a test made by a different character. For instance, making arrows calls for a Fletching (Woodworking · Metalcraft) Success Value test. Here, the Metalcraft represents the crafting of the arrowhead used in the projectile. A smith might provide these already made to a fletcher, and so the Secondary Modifier would be derived from the smith's Metalcraft Index, not the fletcher's.

## bonuses &amp; penalties

Modifiers affect only the EML of d100 Success Tests, and do not also adjust the Secondary Modifiers and Secondary Rolls that might accompany them. Secondary Mastery is based purely on Index, itself derived from ML .

## special d10 rolls

Sometimes the rules call for a special d10 roll against a Target Number (TN). These are resolved just like for Secondary Rolls (left), but the TN often has a completely unique source-such as those used in the shield Deflect weapon trait (page 98) or in the Weather Rolls of the Trekking Routine (page 144). Any modification to the TN will be listed with the pertinent rules. For instance, the TN of Temperature Rolls made in mountainous terrain are reduced by 2.
