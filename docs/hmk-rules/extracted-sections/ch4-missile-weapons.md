# Missile Weapons

## Missile Weapons

Personal missile weapons are divided into four groupsbows, crossbows, slings, and thrown weapons.

## Bows

Bows are hand-drawn, vertical staves that shoot arrows. Professional bowyers distinguish between the self bow (single piece of wood) and the composite bow (laminated combination of horn, sinew, and wood).

The majority of cultures throughout Kethira have used self bows for millennia without any substantial change in their overall size and construction. Self bows usually have a length roughly equal to the user's arm span-about five to six feet or more. Shorter ones are certainly possible, but these begin to represent the much less effective bow of a child or Gargun. To its great advantage, a self bow can be made cheaply and in a matter of only days.

The horse-culture people of the Lythian central plain traditionally employ the composite bow, the glue of which holds up better in the drier climate. The design of the composite bow allows for a more powerful shot than a self bow of the same draw, and its overall length when strung is only about four feet, ideally suited for use from horseback. However, constructing it is expensive and can take up to a year.

In addition to the material differences between the two bow types, folk also make several colloquial distinctions.

Hunting bow-War bow : archers most often describe their weapons as either hunting bows or war bows. Although somewhat arbitrary, the distinction essentially emerges from the bow's power. The lighter the draw, the longer it may be held ready when stalking prey (hunting bow); the heavier the draw, the more capable it is of delivering higher impact shots at a greater range (war bow).

Small bow-Large bow : feudal and imperial realms throughout Venarive sometimes categorise bows as either small bows or large bows, a contrast often making it into official written musters as SB and LB. However, these two abbreviations refer less to the physical size of the bow than to the above difference in draw weight. A SB is a small-draw hunting bow; a LB is a large-draw war bow. This distinction is born not out of strategy but rather the material reality at hand and the comparative training exhibited by the archers. Drawing large war bows requires decades of practice, usually from childhood.

Longbow-Crossbow : with the advent of the crossbow, many folk now call the self bow the longbow . This is not a description of the stave length-it has always been fairly long-but rather a way to distinguish it from the crossbow . That is, the selfbow's upright and long stave is contrasted with the crossbow's horizontal and short prod.

Longbow-Shortbow : trade, warfare, and migration have each to varying degrees brought the disparate cultures of Venarive into contact with each other. The composite bow is, therefore, not unfamiliar in realms where the self bow holds historical and popular sway. In fact, folk often call the composite bow a shortbow in obvious contrast to the much longer stave of the self bow. However, the shorter composite bow remains rare in the climate of northwestern Venarive where greater humidity makes its long-term and widespread use less viable.

Hartbow : Ælrhin bowyers of Kethira imbue their missile weapons with an elven essence that greatly increases their performance-a process called faeriecraft . They call such missile weapons hartbows . These are usually the singlepiece self bow variety for the very same climatic reasons that encourages them in other northern cultures.

## Crossbows

Crossbows have hand- or mechanically-drawn horizontal prods that project short, thick projectiles called bolts. The most common crossbows are made entirely of wood, while the Kuzhai have developed more powerful composite prods of horn and wood or-allegedly-all steel.

While their rate of fire suffers in comparison to bows, crossbows are much easier to use. Those untrained have an ML equal to SB × 3 rather than SB × 1. Archers may also carry crossbows loaded as long as they hold them horizontal to the ground (otherwise, the bolt simply slips off).

## Slings

Slings are straps or loops used to hurl stones. Prevalent among cultures of the Venarian Sea, slings require even more training to master than bows.

a

## strength impact modifier

The archer's Strength affects the performance of missile weapons in different ways:

Bows are rated by Draw (DRW). The higher the draw, the greater the impact and range. Archers have a Pull rating equal to Archery ML plus Strength ML. Pull must at least equal draw in order to span and shoot the bow.

Crossbows have a Draw just like bows. Archers can usually span weaker crossbows with their own hands; stronger ones require the use of mechanical devices called spanners (page 108).

Slings receive the Strength Impact Modifier (page 97).

Thrown weapons minus 1, as shown on page 97.

## projectiles

The projectiles of bows (called arrows) and crossbows (called bolts) both have two traitsshaft weight and head type.	Some	crossbows require	the	archer	to	use	a	mechanical	spanner	to	reload.	See	the Missile Sequence (page	163)	for	shooting	projectiles.

## projectile  shaft

The	mass	of	the	projectile's	shaft	directly affects	strike	impact	but	inversely	affects volley	range.

| shaft   | imp ⚫   | vm-b   | vm-c   | price   |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| Heavy   | d12      | ×3     | ×2     | 15d     |
| Light   | d8       | ×4     | ×3     | 12d     |

- shaft the rules distinguish between two	shaft	weights: heavy or light .	Heavy arrow	shafts	weigh	around	3.5	ounces; light	ones,	around	2	ounces.	Crossbow shafts	have	a	comparable	mass,	but	are thicker	with	about	a	third	the	length.
- imp heavy	shafts	give	projectiles	a d12 strike	impact	die;	light	shafts,	a d8 .	The impact modifier is	determined	by	the missile	weapon's draw ,	as	indicated	by the	bonus	after	the	(	⚫ )	symbol	in	the weapon	tables	(as	explained	above).
- vm-b the maximum volley multiplier applied	to	a	bow's	base	range	(BR) when	making	a	volley	attack.	Thus,	a heavy	arrow	has	a	volley	range	of	BR × 3; light	arrows	extend	it	to	BR × 4.
- vm-c the maximum volley multiplier for a	crossbow	bolt.	Although	less	than a	bow's	maximum	range,	crossbows usually	have	a	higher	relative	BR.
- price the cost to purchase twelve projectiles for a bow or crossbow in all head	types.

## projectile  head

The	design	of	the	head	of	the	projectile, whether	arrow	or	bolt,	affects	how	it inflicts	trauma.

| head   | effect               |
|--------|----------------------|
| Bodkin | ar 4 p • impact ta 3 |
| Blunt  | half strike impact   |
| Broad  | bleeding 5           |

- bodkin the	narrow	head	more	easily penetrates	armour.	Strike	impact includes armour reduction 4 p (page 111) and impact ta 3	(page	98).
- blunt the	head	halves	strike	impact after	impact	die	roll	and	all	modifiers.
- broad the wide sharp edges of the head more	easily	inflict	bleeding	injury. After	determining	the	missile	strike's Injury	Severity	(Injury	Sequence,	step 3, page	168),	add	five	to	Effective	Impact. Use	the	new	'virtual'	injury	level	to	see	if the	impact	causes	a	bleeder,	if	it	did	not already. The original Injury Severity does not change in either case .	See	the	Melee Example for a demonstration of the effect	(page	173,	top	of	column	2).

## crossbow  spanners

Archers can use mechanical spanners on a	crossbow	to	multiply	their	Pull	rating.

| spanner        | pull   | reload   |   lb | pr   |
|----------------|--------|----------|------|------|
| Belt&Claw      | ×3     | 2 rounds |    2 | 10d  |
| Lever [ k ]    | ×5     | 4 rounds |    3 | 25d  |
| Windlass [ k ] | ×10    | 8 rounds |    5 | 60d  |

- belt &amp; claw a	hook	attached	to	a	belt pulls	the	string	back	when	reloaders put their foot through a stirrup at the end of the crossbow and straighten their	back.	This	triples	(×3)	their	Pull	but requires	a	2-round	action	to	complete.
- lever a Kuzhan device that attaches to the crossbow stirrup and enables reloaders to push or pull with their arms	to	bring	back	the	string.	It multiplies	Pull	by	five	(×5)	but	takes	a 4-round	action	to	complete.
- windlass a	Kuzhan	device	of	pulleys and rotating arms attached to the end of the crossbow that allows the reloader to	crank	back	the	string.	It	multiplies Pull	by	ten	(×10)	but	requires	an 8-round	action	to	complete.

## Composite Bow [simple]

(Ketari bow)  An expensive and time-consuming glued construction of strips of wood with animal	sinew	on	the	'back',	or	outer	side	(for	flexing),	and animal bone on its 'belly', or inner side (for resisting); can be wielded as a fragile club ( lng 4 · zd d6	·	d6 + 0 b · WQ reduced by 5 in Weapon Damage Rolls).

Elven	bows	can	be	of	either	variety	and-humbly adorned-	resemble	any	other.	However,	the	innate Faeriecraft	of	Ælrhin	bowyers	imbues	the	weapon	with extraordinary	performance	(half	the	draw	weight).

## crossbows

## Composite Crossbow [simple]

(Siege crossbow)  With a string as thick as a thumb and a composite wood and horn prod, the stout compound crossbow almost invariably requires a mechanical spanner. For this reason many are relegated to siege defence, where the shooters can more easily gain shelter during the time-consuming reloading.

|   wq |   drw |   br | imp    |   lb | price   |

## Wooden Crossbow [common]

(Hunting	crossbow)	 Light-draw versions are not uncommon hunting weapons. The archer's ability to hold and aim shots grants an advantage in stalking game.

## slings

## Hand Sling [common]

(Shepherd's sling)  A braided or hemp string attached to a leather pouch. Properly hurling the lead stone missile is essentially impossible untrained. Of the various arm patterns of winding, some require only one or two circuits.

<!-- image -->

## Staff Sling [simple]

(War sling)  Even untrained slingers can manage to lob stones with the staff	sling	(untrained	use	is	SM 1).	It	does	not	have	a	greater	range	than	the	hand sling	but	can	hurl	heavier	objects,	like	pots	of	fire,	an	equal	distance.	Combatants can wield the	staff	in	melee	as	a	club	( hft 11	· lng 5	·	d6 + 1 b ).

<!-- image -->

Using slings involves the following special rules:

Stones : the d10 b -aspect	impact	assumes	specially	crafted	lead	ovoid bullets	(twelve	weigh	2	lb · price		9d · Metalcraft	4d;	1	day).	Improvised rocks	have	a	-10	attack	penalty	and	reduce	base	range	by	30	feet.

⬛ b :	slingers	add	their	Strength	Impact	modifier	(page	97)	to	a successful	strike,	which	inflict	Blunt	(B)	aspect	injuries.

## thrown weapons

Characters make thrown weapon attacks by following the Missile Sequence (page 163). Include the following special rules.

| weapon   | hft    |   br | vm   | pb-zd   | imp             |
|----------|--------|------|------|---------|-----------------|
| Javelin  | 11     |   60 | ×2   | d6      | d8+2 p          |
| Shorkana | 10     |   40 | ×2   | d8      | d8+2 e          |
| Spear    | 13     |   40 | ×2   | d8      | d8+3 p          |
| Taburi   | 7      |   30 | ×2   | d6      | d8+0 p          |
| Others   | varies |   15 | ×2   | d8      | melee impact -2 |

Heft ( hft ):	Heft	penalties	apply	to	Throwing	tests	(page	98).

Base Range ( br ):	commonly	thrown	weapons	have	their	own	base range,	given	in	feet.	For	others,	assume	BR	15	feet.

Volley Multiplier ( vm ):	all	thrown	weapons	have	VM ×2	when	the combatant	takes	the	Attack	(Missile) action.

Point Blank Zone Die ( pb-zd ):	throws	at	point-blank	range	use	the Zone	Die	given	in	the	table	above.	Beyond	this	range,	all	thrown weapons	use	d8	ZD	for	direct	attacks;	and	d10	ZD	for	volley	attacks.

Charging Throw :	combatants	may	test	Throwing	with	the	Charge action.	If	at	least	20	feet	are	covered	before	the	throw	in	the	same action,	then	there	are	three	special	effects:	1)	Direct	attack	strike impact	increases	by	1;	2)	VM	increases	to	×3;	and	3)	a	thrower	with	a positive Strength	Secondary	Modifier	(page	62)	may	add	its	bonus	to the	weapon's	Base	Range		for	calculating	volley	ranges.

## 20-ft charging throw

| Direct Attack:   | Strike Impact +1    |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Volley Attack:   | Volley multiple ×3; |
|                  | STRModbonustoBR     |

Example : a character with STR 14 (Secondary	Modifier	+10)	makes	a Missile volley attack with a javelin after	a	25-ft	charge.	Volley  2	range increases	to	140	feet	(60 + 10 × 2 ); volley  3	is	210	feet	(60 + 10 × 3 ).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Constricted PB : staff	slings are	awkward	to	direct	at	very	close	range. When	the	target	is	60	feet	away	or	less,	the	slinger	does	not	receive the	+10	point	blank	bonus	to	the	Sling	attack	test.

Heavy Load : staff	slings can	launch	Fire	and	Quicklime	Pots	(page	81), but	with	BR	60	and	VM×2.	Resolve	as	Thrown	Objects,	below.

## thrown objects

Characters may throw non-aerodynamic objects , such as containers and stones. Except where noted, the process follows the Missile Sequence as for thrown weapons.

| container          | stone   |   hft |   br | vm   | pb-zd   | imp       |   lb |
|--------------------|---------|-------|------|------|---------|-----------|------|
| Glass Vial, 4 oz   | 2″ dia  |     6 |   60 | ×2   | d6      | d6+S b -1 |  0.5 |
| Glass Jar, 1 pt    | 3″ dia  |    10 |   40 | ×2   | d8      | d6+S b -1 |  2   |
| Ceramic Jar, 1 qt  | 4″ dia  |    14 |   30 | ×2   | d8      | d6+S b -1 |  5   |
| Ceramic Pot, 2 qt  | 6″ dia  |    18 |   15 | ×2   | d8      | d6+S b -1 |  9   |
| Ceramic Jug, 1 gal | 7″ dia  |    22 |    5 | ×2   | d8      | d6+S b -1 | 16   |

Throwing Objects :	-10	penalty;	-20	penalty	if	oblong,	like	a	torch. BR :	for	objects	with	BR	5	ft,	increase	by	an	amount	in	feet	equal	to positive STR Impact bonus	when	making	a	Charging	Throw	(left).

Impact :	imparted	only	by	objects	that	do	not	easily	shatter,	such	as most	stones	and	rocks; S =	the	thrower's	Strength	Impact	modifier.

Lb :	pounds;	if	a	container	is	empty,	use	data	from	one	row	above.

Grenades : combatants	may	lob weapons and objects to a point on the ground rather	than	at	a	specific	target.	In	place	of	the	Direct	and Volley	Attack	tables,	deviation	for	such	'grenades'	is	measured	by	the Throwing	success	level	and	the	distance	to	the	target	point.	The

| distance   | ≤ 5   | in 15   | ft to 30   | target 60   | point 90   | 120   |
|------------|-------|---------|------------|-------------|------------|-------|
