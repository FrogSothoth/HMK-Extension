## Divination

Like other arcanists, most diviners throughout Lythia understand magic forces Pvarically, according to the spectrum of elemental principles anchored by Earth, Metal, Fire, Air, Aura, and Water. Among the three arcane mysteries, divination interacts the least directly with the principles, and so its magic manifests the most subtly. Whereas the incanter directly channels ethereal energies to cast spells or invoke talents, and the alchemist obliquely manipulates them to create elixirs, the diviner merely observes them.

Diviners interpret the principles in order to make statements about the future. The three methods detailed in this section are Astrology, Runecraft, and Tarotry, although others exist throughout Kethira's many cultures. The arcane talents of Clairvoyance, Psychometry, and Visnomy are not divination, as their power concerns the present or past (likewise for the Savoryan spells Enquiry and Wisdom). However, the Prescience talent is the divinatory equivalent of Natural Attunement-an innate arcane ability to observe the future. Many revered 'oracles' throughout the world likely render their visions with Prescience. Whatever the method, all divination functions with a clear distinction between destiny and fate.

## Destiny (Will)

Characters forge their own destiny through the decisions they make. In game terms, attribute and skill tests most obviously reflect this will: the player has the character undertake an action, the outcome of which is then expressed as failure or success. A character can change destiny by changing the course of action. An entire campaign, then, is a playing out of a character's destinythe unknown future-through successive tests of action.

## Fate

While both destiny and fate refer to the actions of a character's life, a character's fate is preordained as an element of timeless Kelestia (reality). Unlike destiny, it cannot be 'changed' because it does not follow from a character's actions, but rather always already encompasses them-no matter the choice. Thus, one may decide to step aboard a ship sailing to a far-off land (one course of destiny)-or not (another course of destiny). But whatever the character's choice-whatever the destiny-fate already contains or 'knows' that choice.

Divination attempts to glimpse fate, not destiny. This narrative concept has always been difficult to reflect in the mechanics of an RPG. However, the following

rules for Fate Points manifest just exactly that, enabling players to control their character's destiny through their decisions, while still reflecting the ineluctable march of the character's fate throughout those very same choices.

## divinatory blindness

Critical Failures in several divinatory ability tests detailed in this section can cause Divinatory Blindness, a dangerous exposure to the principles being viewed by the arcanist. When this happens, roll d100:

## d100 divinatory blindness

- 01-75 minor haze :	the	divinatory	vision	is	exposed	to	pure principle,	resulting	in Aural	Shock 1 (page	190).
- 76-95 serious haze :	same	as	01-75,	but	the	haze	inflicts	Aural Shock	3.
- 96-00 grievous haze :	same	as	01-75,	but	the	haze	inflicts Aural	Shock	5.

Crucial Divinatory Blindness : a Divinatory Misfire Roll ending in a 5 or 0 results in Crucial Divinatory Blindness. In addition to the corresponding Aural Shock, the diviner suffers actual blindness (page 184). Every d3 days, test HB × HR5 on the Exposure Healing Roll table (page 185). When HR rises to 6, the blindness is removed.

## fate points

A character's soul functions with the same timelessness as does fate. In addition to gauging how well characters can manipulate arcane energies, Aura also determines how readily the soul reveals its own fate. Such opportunities to glimpse this truth are quantified as Fate Points (FP).

When a player wishes to reveal a PC's fate (ultimate reality) out of his or her destiny (chosen course of action), consult the following Fate Routine.

## Fate Routine

The moment some test of the PC generates a success level (CF · F · S · CS), the player may decide to make one Fate Roll to improve it. The character must possess at least 1 Fate Point and must not currently suffer from Aural Shock (see other Fate Roll Prohibitions, right). The previous test for which the Fate Roll is made is called the Fated Test .

To make a Fate Roll, follow these steps.

[�] Test : a Fate Roll tests ML50 + Aura Secondary Modifier. The Fate Attunement ability permanently increases this ML by an amount equal to the highest Index of Astrology, Runecraft, Tarotry, or Prescience.

[�] Sunsign : further adjust the Fate Roll by the Sunsign Modifier of the skill group to which the Fated Test's skill belongs. This can be -15, -10, -5, 0, +5, +10, or +15. Fated attribute tests and Healing Rolls have zero modifier.

[�] Other Bonuses : add bonuses from other sources, such as from Harmony (Savorya II), Runecasting, and Tarotry.

[�] Fate Roll : resolve the test on the Fate Roll table (fatigue, impairment, or Shock State have no effect):

## fate roll

- cf No	effect	and	character	loses	one	FP .
- f No	effect.
- s +1	success	level	to	Fated	Test	and	character	loses	1	FP .
- cs +1	success	level	to	Fated	Test	and	no	FP	loss-or	(player's choice) +2	success	level	to	Fated	Test	and	loss	of	1	FP .

[�] Result : apply the result to the Fated Test's success level and proceed as if that were its in-world result all along. Fate Rolls can even increase a Fated Test CS-simply add one victory star per success level increase from the Fate Roll to the original CS result.

If the Fate Roll calls for it, reduce the character's Fate Point total by 1, down to a minimum 0 FP.

Secondary Rolls : if the Fated Test included a Secondary Roll, then a Fate Roll S or CS makes the SR a success, if not so already. A Fate Roll F or CF leaves the SR unchanged.

Fated Tiebreaks : after applying a successful Fate Roll, the Fated Test always wins tiebreaks against non-Fated tests, no matter its original dice roll (see the following example).

Fate Roll Example : a PC with Dodge ML 53 tries to avoid a strike from an attacker with Melee ML 72. The PC rolls 55 (CF) and the attacker rolls 62 (S). The PC makes a Fate Roll to improve the CF. With AUR12 (Secondary Modifier +5) and Feneri Sunsign (+5 Combat Group modifier), the Fate Roll has EML 60 (50 + 5 + 5). The d100 result is 15 (CS).

The PC has two choices: (1) lose no FP and improve the Fated Melee skill test one level to a Failure; or (2) lose one FP and improve it two levels to a Success and a tie with the attacker. Since Fated rolls always win tiebreaks, the PC chooses the second option, receiving a one-star victory despite the literal Dodge roll number (55) being lower than the attack roll (62).

## fate roll prohibitions

No test involving AUR may be a Fated Test . Aura and Esoterica skill tests and SR may never be altered by a Fate Roll. The Aura attribute already implies the most powerful connection to Kelestia: no more can possibly be 'revealed'.

No random roll may be a Fated Test . For example, the results of Zone and Location Dice, impact rolls, and d100 Spell Misfire rolls may not be altered by a Fate Roll.

No personal Fate Roll is allowed at 0 FP . With no Fate Points, characters may only make a Fate Roll if they have access to a source of FP other than their own, such as the 'FP pools' associated with Rune-engraved objects.

No creature or NPC has Fate Points . Creatures and NPCs have destiny in the world, but the initial results of the GM dice rolls for their actions already reflect their fate.

## Fate Point Increases

At the end of a game session, a d10 is rolled for each PC who currently has 0 to 4 FP (no d10 roll is made if the PC has 5 or more FP). If the result exceeds the current FP amount, 1 FP is added to the total. If the d10 result is equal to or less than the current FP , there is no increase.

Gaming groups may prefer to make such Fate Point Increase rolls once per in-world month, rather than per game session. GMs may also choose to grant extra rolls (or automatic amounts) at important narrative milestones of the campaign, similar to XP and SDR awards (page 413).

Divination : the skills of Astrology, Prescience, and Trance can provide additional Fate Point Increase rolls, even allowing for a PC's FP total to rise above 5. See the Divination Readings and Divination Objects sections in the Astromancy Routine (page 280) for more details.

Earthmaster objects and Runecrafted objects can also express Fate Point pools , allotments of FP that PCs may spend independently of their personal FP amounts. Once spent, the FP granted by such objects are permanently lost.

Fate Increase Example : a PC ends a game session with 4 FP . A d10 is rolled: a 7 exceeds the 4 FP , so the PC gains 1 FP , raising the new amount to 5. The following session ends with the PC still having 5 FP, so no d10 Fate Point Increase roll is made this time.

## Astrology

The  world of Kethira is the second of five known planets orbiting the star Nolomar. Astrologers observe and interpret the alignment and motion of the planets, sun, and Kethira's moon-Yael-as expressions of the Pvaric elemental principles. Astrology allows them to translate these observations into predictions about a person's future. While such projections can be vague, even their subtle accuracy makes astrologers popular among both kings and common folk.

Astrologers have three core abilitiesStar Attunement , Sunsign Perception , and Astromancy . These require concentration (page 182) and have the same trauma restrictions as Arcane Talent use (page 259). Astrologers also have the special quality called Fate Attunement (sidebar).

## Star Attunement

Astrologers may study the alignment of the stars in order to increase the opportunities for their own soul's chance to connect to fate. To attempt such Star Attunement, the astrologer follows these steps:

[�] Time : the astrologer studies the stars for one hour at night-time.

[�] Night Sky Modifier : apply a modifier to the test according to the cloud cover of the night sky-Clear (0) or Cloudy (-20). Star Attunement is not possible in Overcast conditions.

[�] Test : make an Astrology test with the Night Sky modifier on the Star Attunement table (sidebar). All types of fatigue apply. A Grievous skull injury or being stunned or incapacitated prevent it altogether.

[�] Duration : the result of the Star Attunement roll lasts 30 days, regardless of success level.

## Sunsign Perception

An astrologer who spends time in conversation with someone through a common language may attempt to ascertain the person's sunsign. Knowing this essential element of personality enhances the astrologer's persuasion tests against the target. Successful Sunsign Perception also serves as True Sight, enabling the astrologer to perceive the target's True Form (page 209 sidebar). All types of fatigue apply.

True Form : a character whose True Form is concealed may not be a target of Sunsign Perception.

[�] Time : ten-minute conversation (or one-minute with -20 penalty).

[�] Communication : the shared language complexity between the astrologer and the target modifies EML: Index 0-2 (-10 penalty); Index 3-5 (0); Index 6-8 (+5 bonus); Index 9 or more (+10 bonus). Using a translator lowers these modifiers by 20. Without a shared language or a translator, Sunsign Perception cannot be attempted. Telepathic communication that has no language requirement grants +20 bonus.

[�] Test : test Astrology EML on the Sunsign Perception table in the sidebar. All types of fatigue apply, and Grievous skull injury or being stunned or incapacitated prevent it altogether.

[�] Duration : the result of the Sunsign Perception roll lasts 30 days, regardless of success level. However, successfully perceiving a True Form is permanent-astrologers retain it in their 'esoteric memory'.

## fate attunement

The study of the arcane mystery of fate increases the attunement of one's own soul to it. A character's Fate Roll ML is increased by an amount equal to the highest Index of Astrology, Runecraft, Tarotry, or Prescience.

## star attunement

## astrology test

- cf No	effect,	plus	the	astrologer	tests Will . Any	failure	causes	Divinatory	Blindness (page	275).
- f No	effect.
- s One extra d10 is rolled 1) when the Astrologer	makes	a	d10	Fate	Increase	roll (page	276),	and	2)	for	the	Astrologer	as	a querent in	Astromancy	(page	280).	In	both cases,	the	lowest	d10	result	is	then	ignored.
- cs As	for	Success	(S),	but two extra d10 are rolled and two lowest	results	are	ignored.

Star Attunement Example : on a clear night of 12 Halane, an astrologer attempts Star Attunement. With an Astrology ML81, the roll is 92-Failure (F) and no effect for 30 days. The following month on 12 Savor, the astrologer tries again, but this time under cloudy conditions. Against  Astrology EML61, the roll is 25-Critical Success (CS). For the next 30 days, the astrologer rolls two extra d10s in both Fate Increase Rolls and for those resulting from being a querent in an Astromancy Roll.

## sunsign perception

## astrology test

- cf No	effect,	plus	target	unsettled	by astrologer.	Attempts	at	persuasion	have	a -10	penalty	indefinitely	(until	the	astrologer successfully	persuades	the	target).
- f No	effect.
- s Astrologer	fathoms	the	target's	Sunsign(s) and	True	Form.	Attempts	of	persuasion receive +5 bonus.
- cs Astrologer	fathoms	the	target's	Sunsign(s), Sunsign	Personality	Trait(s),	and	True	Form. Persuasion	tests	receive	+10	bonus.

Sunsign Perception Example : an astrologer converses with a foreign baron who has been visiting her own noble patron. Able to catch his ear for only a minute, the astrologer attempts Sunsign Perception against EML61 (lowered by 20 from the brief interaction; 0 modifier from her basic language fluency). The roll is 42-Success (S). She permanently fathoms his True Form and Tai sunsign, and has +5 bonus to persuasion skills against him for the next 30 days.

## sunsign wheel

The Sunsign Wheel displays the twelve sunsigns on the outer rim in line with their corresponding Pvaric elements (convocations). Thus, the first sunsign of the year (I Ulandus) is positioned in the lower left, in line with Fyvria; the others appear counterclockwise from here, up to the top and down to the last sunsign of the year (XII Lado), corresponding with Odivshe. Astrological tables, such as on the following page, list sunsigns in order of their position in the Tuzyn Reckoning calendar, starting with Ulandus (first row/new year) through Lado (last row/end of year).

## ix tai: The Lantern Bearer

4 Savôr-2 Ilvín

The Lantern Bearer-also known as the Guide-represents the quest for pure knowledge, even at the cost of the mundane and earthly. Taians have great, sometimes naive, curiosity, and, while avoiding strong emotions, gladly teach others their discoveries.

## x skôrus: The Mixer

3 Ilvín-2 Návek x The Mixer blends intellect and emotion. Skorans enjoy life and bringing pleasure. They make good friends and delight in bringing people together, whether through their study and exploration of the world, or from founding home and family. x

## xi masâra: The Chalice

3 Návek-1 Morgát The chalice is the sign of love and pleasure, cool darkness, security and emotion. Its water symbolises the eternal-both fertility and death. A Masaran can share endless love, but also hold intense grudges or even express cold hatred.

## xii ládo: The Galley

i ii 2 Morgát-3 Núzyæl The Galley symbolises the return from a perilous, yet fulfilling, journey. Ladoans harmonise with their surroundings, not shrinking from the dangers of the sea. They remain afloat through any storm, only to sleep calmly and finally in winter. i ii

## i ùlándus: The Tree

4 Núzyæl-3 Peónu

The great Tree speaks to change and rebirth of spring-the consistency of both decay and growth anew. Ulandans are often wise to the cycles of renewal and reliable in troubled times. Their aloofness to the world around belies a tenacious rootedness.

## ii arálius: The Wands

4 Peónu-2 Kelén

The second and central sign of spring and earth, Aralius symbolises pure growth. The Wands sprout leaves from their severed lengths-just as an Aralian embraces the potential of the new and a zest for the life within.

<!-- image -->

iii iii

## viii táræl: The Pentacle 5 Halánè-3 Savôr

The Pentacle manifests hidden knowledge and wealth through subtle, sometimes misleading, action. Tarælans approach problems indirectly, along a path of least resistance. While patient to the intangible, they also tend towards procrastination.

## vii hîrin: The Eagle

6 Azúra-4 Halánè

vii Cousin to the Salamander's soaring spirit, the Eagle cannot be constrained. Hirinans, however, bring more precision to their flight. While they chafe against authority, their actions are swift and precise, intelligently aloof, and even merciless. vii

## vi nadái: The Salamander

vi v 7 Ágrazhâr-5 Azúra The Salamander mixes fire and air-a symbol of unfocused energy, visible but unreal. Nadaians are imaginative and spontaneous, yet moody. They evade destruction, rather than withstand it, and their dynamic action often bears little reward. vi v

## v angberélius: The Flaming Swords

5 Laránè-6 Ágrazhâr The Swords express action and conflict, strife and glory-that which arises from penetrating effort. Angberelians lead exciting lives-the questing warrior or the wild mage-and face troubles head-on, without subtlety.

## iv áhnù: The Fire Dragon

4 Nólus-4 Laránè

The Dragon purifies what the Smith creates, preparing the world for renewal. Ahnuans are perfectionists, even intolerant and certainly critical. They favour experimentation and revolution, rather than conservation and the old.

## iii fenéri: The Smith

3 Kelén-3Nólus

The sign of forging and tempering, the Smith produces artifact from nature. Fenerians are manipulators, working productively to improve the world. They transform themselves through striving, evolving through ordeals whether successful or not.

## Astromancy

An astrologer gives an astromantic reading for a character, called the querent , by taking the following steps. This requires concentration (page 182) by both parties, and trauma affects the reader just like it does in Arcane Talent use (step 2 on page 259).

True Form : no character whose True Form is concealed may participate in astromancy, as either reader or querent (page 209 sidebar).

[�] Reading Time and Cost : the reader and querent spend one hour in face-to-face communication-this is called the reading. Prestigious guild astrologers may charge 180d per reading (or 60d per star rating).

[�] Communication : the shared language complexity between the two modifies Astrology EML: Index 0-2 (-10 penalty); Index 3-5 (0); Index 6-8 (+5 bonus); Index 9 or more (+10 bonus). Using a translator lowers these modifiers by 20. Without a shared language, translator, or telepathic communication (+20 bonus), the reading cannot take place.

[�] Astrological Position : determine the Astrological Position according to the exact date the astromantic reading takes place.

| dateofastromanticreading                      | position   |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------|
| 18 Morgát through all of Núzyæl to 17 Peónu   | 1st        |
| 18 Peónu through all of Kelén to 19 Nólus     | 2nd        |
| 20 Nólus through all of Laránè to 21 Ágrazhâr | 3rd        |
| 22 Ágrazhâr through all of Azúra to 19 Halánè | 4th        |
| 20 Halánè through all of Savôr to 17 Ilvín    | 5th        |
| 18 Ilvín through all of Návek to 17 Morgát    | 6th        |

[�] Astrological Modifier : find the modifier to the step 5 Astromancy Roll according to the querent's birth Sunsign and the reading's Astrological Position as determined in step 3. For cusp Sunsigns, use the modifier most advantageous to the querent.

| querent     | astrological position   | astrological position   | astrological position   | astrological position   | astrological position   | astrological position   |

Example : a reading on 21 Halane is in the 5th Astrological Position. A querent with a Hir-Tar cusp Sunsign receives +10 bonus to the Astromancy Roll.

[�] Formulation : after the reading takes place, the astrologer takes 3d6 hours to formulate the reading. This formulation must take place within 30 days of the reading or the astromancy fails.

## astromantic readings

The Kethiran zodiac is grouped into twelve sunsigns according to Pvaric principles. The scheme's progression symbolises life from birth to death and back to rebirth-from the beginning of Spring (I Ulandus) to the end of Winter (XII Lado). The six convocations of the Pvaric Wheel match this sequence-from the active growth of Fyvria to the entropic silence of Odivshe. The illustration of the twelve sunsigns and the six convocations on page 278 begins with Ulandus/Fyvria in the lower left section, circles to the right and up, and ends with Lado/Odivshe in the middle left.

Astromancy is the astrologer's ability to interpret the Pvaric elements-as expressed through observations of the planets, moon, and sun-into probable statements about a person's future. Such statements are called a reading . However, in-game, no literal description of the future need be provided by the GM. Instead, the likely vague in-world advice given by the astromancer manifests as an increase to Fate Points, reflecting greater insight concerning the character's future.

Thus, when a character's Fate Points have been used to affect the success level of a later action, such as blocking an enemy's sword strike, the player should view this as a fate that has always been dictated for the character despite the game mechanic of making the Fate Roll 'after the fact'. For the character, it was always so in-world. If the spent Fate Point had resulted from an astromantic reading, the character would likely have gleaned some earlier cryptic admonition from the astrologer (' you shall one day soon fend off an aggressor at a timely moment '). On the other hand, if the ingame Fate Roll had failed to improve the block, then the in-world reading would have reflected that fate instead (' it is folly to wish for succour at all times ').

## narrative astromancy

In addition to the quantified game mechanics related to fate, the GM is also encouraged to narrate specific elements of a reading that will contribute to the unfolding campaign. Thus, when characters visit an astrologer, the GM will not only guide them through the Astromancy Routine but could also roleplay several cryptic utterances that their characters hear from the astrologer. The content could be red herrings but, better yet, could instead include a pertinent name or place that furthers the story or primes the players for later recognition. Such creativity contributes great value to an RPG, independent of game mechanics.

## astromancy example

An astrologer in the town of Aleath on the southern coast of Hârn gives an astromantic reading:

## Astrology	ML84	·	Drawing	ML52	·	Maths	ML66

The reader spends an hour with the querent. They share a common language of Basic complexity (0 modifier). The querent has a Hirin Sunsign and the reading takes place on 10 Kelen (-5 Astrological Modifier). After the reading itself, the astrologer spends 3d6 hours formulating the reading-8 hours.

The reader's Drawing Index  5 applies 0 modifier to Astrology EML, producing a final Astromancy EML79 and Mathematics TN6. The Astromancy Roll is 37 (S) and the Secondary Roll is 8 (F). The SV equals 8 (Astrology Index 8 + 0 from the Success + 0 from Mathematics SR).

Since the reading resulted in SV8 (four stars), four d10 rolls are compared to the querent's current FP total of 4: 10, 9, 4, 5. Three rolls exceed the FP 4, so the character adds three to the total, up to FP 7. The astrologer has also now perceived the querent's True Form; this does not alter Astromantic readings, but such True Form perception might affect other actions the astrologer takes involving the querent (see page 209 sidebar).

The GM notes the reader-querent pair, the date of 10 Kelen, and the FP increase of 3. The reader cannot produce a reading for this querent for 30 days. The querent could consult other astrologers during the same 30-day period (or perhaps be included in a Vision of someone with the Prescience arcane talent), but new results apply only if four or five d10 rolls exceed the character's current FP total (whatever that is at the given moment). Even if so, it would result in only +1 or +2 FP , respectively.

## fate increase example

The querent in the above Astromancy example currently has 7 FP . During the next gaming session, the character loses 2 FP , bringing the character's total down to � FP . At the end of the session, the player does not make a d10 Fate Recovery roll, because current FP is not 4 or less.

The campaign continues next session and the PC loses 1 FP , ending with � FP . The PC was also bequeathed a Rune Piece of the Weapon Rune that provides 1 FP (usable for Melee fated skill rolls-see page 284). This 1 FP is an independent 'pool', and, since the PC's personal Fate Point total is 4, a d10 Fate Point Increase roll is made after the session. The die roll is 6, increasing the PC's FP to 5.

At this point, the campaign has progressed 45 days beyond the date of the PC's Astromantic reading on 10 Kelen, so any d10 rolls from a new Astromantic reading would impart 1 FP only if they exceed 5. However, the character and allies find themselves deep in the desolate Ternu Heath, far from the astrologer in Aleath.

[�] Astromancy Roll : the astrologer makes an Astrology (Drawing · Mathematics SR) Success Value test. Modify the EML further by the reader's fatigue (all types); the shared communication between reader and querent (step 2); and the Astrological modifier (step 4).

Mathematics SR : with an Astrology test success (S or CS), increase the resulting SV by � if the Mathematics SR succeeds.

## reader limitations

The same astrologer cannot produce a new reading for the same querent more than once per 30 days, as counted from the most recent reading. Astrologers may perform a reading on themselves-simply count them as both reader and querent.

## reader true sight

A successful Astromancy Roll in step 6 (S or CS) also reveals the querent's True Form to the reader. While a failed roll could still very well result in FP-increase rolls for the querent (from a high enough SV result), an F or CF test result does not provide the reader with enough of an indelible sense of the querent's True Form.

## querent limitations

The same querent may seek readings from as many different diviners as desired and afforded during any given 30-day span. However, subsequent readings apply only if their FP increase exceeds those of all other diviners. If so, increase the querent's FP total by how much the new reading's FP increase exceeds the highest increase of the others.

Thus, the GM must note: 1) the querent-reader pair, 2) the reading date, and 3) the number of FP increased from each reading or source.

Divination Readings : for purposes of Querent Limitations, the term 'diviner' also applies to those who express the Vision ability of the Prescience arcane talent (page 263), and to those who impart oracles from an Energy Spirit Rite (page 305). The FP increased by these two divination techniques and by Astromancy overlap for the same recipient.

Thus, if an Astromantic reading imparts 2 FP and later, within the same 30-day span, a Prescience test of Vision imparts 3 FP, then the character only receives 1 FP from the later Vision, regardless of whether the previous 2 FP have already been spent or not.

Divination Objects : the Nagarith Earthmaster object (page 130) and the Engraved Objects of Runecraft (page 284) impart independent pools of FP apart from the FP granted by Astromancy, Prescience, and Energy Spirit Rites. They do not affect querent limitations, as explained above.

Rune Engraving carry the risk for Aural Shock.

## Runecraft

Like other methods of divination, runecraft is in part the arcane ability of observing and interpreting elemental principles in order to make statements about the future. Less overtly Pvaric than astrologers with their zodiacal approach, runecrafters find the manifestation of the telltale principles through the reading of runestones. The divinatory 'casting' of them appears to be a practice almost exclusive to the northern peoples of the Ivinia and Harbaal regions, together with the Kuzhai, the likely developers of the very skill itself.

## kúzhan kinstones

Runecrafters have two core abilitiesRunecasting and Rune Engraving . They also share with all diviners a quality that enhances their own Fate RollsFate Attunement (sidebar). As a reflection of the dynamic heroic culture shared by both Ivinians and Kuzhai, runecrafting produces a powerful yet fleeting glimpse of fate, as compared with the more ponderous and scholarly astrological approach. None of the abilities cause the arcanist to accrue fatigue, although both Runecasting and Rune Engraving carry the risk for Aural Shock.

## runestones

A set of runestones consists of 25 small pieces of stone, each carved with a unique symbol reflecting its nature. The stones themselves are not magical and do not require attunement; rather, the runecrafter's ability lies in the skilful arcane interpretation of them.

Eighteen of the runestones are uniform among all runecrafters and represent fundamental concepts. They are often referred to as the Lifestones (sidebar). A set's seven remaining runestones are idiosyncratic to the runecrafter's culture. Two examples of such Kinstones are detailed here-those of the Ivinians and Kuzhai (sidebar).

## runic script

The Kuzhai taught the tribal Yarili their angular Khruni script, but it was the Yarili who invented runecasting and taught it to the Kuzhai, and to others. The Ivinians learned the magical uses of runes from the Yarili before how to write with them, and so for them the meanings of the runes were paramount. When they  started writing with them, they changed the values of the letters according to what words had those meanings in their own language, and this massive reassignment is what first distinguished Khruni from Runic.

## Runecasting

A runecrafter's ability to divine the future requires the casting of the runestones-not as in spell casting , but rather more in the sense of throwing . The diviner places the runestones in a bag, gently shakes it, and then extracts a number of pieces according to the particular reading. In the more complicated readings, the several extracted stones are then placed on a surface in a specific pattern, whereupon each stone's customary meaning is interpreted in the context of its relative position and facing. While some traditions utilise wooden objects for runecasting, such runesticks function just like the stone versions.

A reading may be on one of three scales: Close , Near , or Distant . The scale refers to the temporal proximity of the caster's viewing of the querent's Fate. An immediate glimpse requires the casting of just a single stone, the interpretation of which takes mere seconds. Longer views involve multiple runestones and can take several minutes.

When a conscious runecrafter (the reader ) makes a runecasting for someone (the querent ), follow these steps. The reader must remain within 10 feet of the querent throughout the runecasting, and the endeavour requires concentration (page 182) by both parties. Readers may also be their own querents.

True Form : a character whose True Form is concealed may not be the querent of a Runecasting, as explained in the page 209 sidebar.

[�] Fate Scale : the reader announces the scale of the reading, itself perhaps informed by the querent's wishes (see sidebar for explanation of the terms in the following table).

| runecasting   | runecasting   | runecasting   | runecasting   | runecasting   |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| scale         | stones        | time          | modifier      | duration      |
| Close Fate    | 1             | 1 turn        | +10           | Index minutes |
| Near Fate     | 5             | 1 minute      | 0             | Index hours   |
| Distant Fate  | 25            | 10 minutes    | -10           | Index days    |

[�] Communication : the reader and querent's shared language complexity modifies the test: Index 0-2 (-10 penalty); Index 3-5 (0); Index 6-8 (+5 bonus); Index 9 or more (+10 bonus). Using a translator lowers these modifiers by 20. Without a shared language or a translator, the reading cannot take place. Telepathic communication that has no language requirement grants +20 bonus.

[�] Runecasting Roll : make a Runecraft test on the following table: Trauma : as with all esoteric actions, fatigue penalty applies. Usually no other impairment applies.

## runecasting roll

- cf No	effect-the	querent's	future	is	cloudy.	The	reader	must	make	a Will test; any	failure	causes	a	roll	for	Divinatory	Blindness	(page	275).
- f No	effect-the	querent's	future	is	cloudy	to	the	reader.
- s Querent	receives	+20	bonus	to	the	next	Fate	Roll	made	within	duration.	The runecaster also perceives the querent's	True	Form.
- cs Querent receives a +30 bonus pool for	Fate	Rolls	made	within	duration.	The querent	selects	a	bonus	for	each	given	Fate	Roll,	reducing	the	remaining	pool by	a	like	amount.	The	runecaster	perceives	the	querent's	True	Form.

[�] Duration : as given in step 1 according to scale.

## runecasting table

Scale : a relative term describing how far into the querent's future the reader focuses.

Stones : the number of runestones drawn from the bag. This does not affect the game routine, aside from implying a greater complexity for the longer scales.

Time : the length of time the reader spends in concentration in order to draw, place, and interpret the runestones. The single stone of a Close reading need only be drawn and held.

Modifier : the modifier to the test, based upon Scale. Runecasting is clearer in the short term.

Duration : how long a runecasting remains accurate for the designated querent-a factor of Runecraft Index.

## runecasting limitations

Reader : no runecrafter can produce a reading of any scale for the same querent more often than once per duration according to the current reading's scale-even if the reading failed.

Querent : among several readings by different runecrafters, the same querent benefits from only the reading with the highest success level (or the one that took place first among ties).

## reader true sight

A successful Runecasting Roll in step 3 (S or CS) reveals the querent's True Form to the runecaster (page 209 sidebar).

## runecasting example

In the middle of a raging melee from a rival clan's assault, a runecrafter huddles behind a wall next to an allied PC warrior. Just before the warrior rushes into the fray, the runecrafter draws a single rune from his rune bag and utters a cryptic word of encouragement to the warrior. With a Runecraft ML71, the Runecasting Roll is against EML81 (+10 from the Close reading). A roll of 62 is Success (S)the warrior receives +20 bonus to his next Fate Roll made within the next 7 minutes.

The warrior rushes out to engage the enemy. Within a minute, his critically failed Melee test in defence against an attacker successfully swinging a battleaxe could prove fatal. The warrior's player announces a Fate Roll to improve the CF (page 276). With an Aura 8 (ML40) and Combat Group modifier +5, the Fate Roll is against EML70 (ML50 5 AUR Secondary Modifier + 5 Combat group + 20 Runecasting bonus). The roll is 52-Success (S). The PC loses 1 FP and the Melee CF is raised to Failure (F) , enough to avoid both the CF Mishap and granting a Tactical Advantage to the foe.

## rune engraved objects

Rune Piece : a single rune is carved onto the face of a palm-sized medallion weighing less than one pound. One attuned possessor may wear, hold, or pocket it.

Maximum Runes:

�

Engraving Time:

5 + d6 days

Maximum Fate:

� FP

Rune Device : up to half Runecraft Index runes are carved on an object that one attuned possessor carries. The object must weigh between one and Runecraft Index × 5 pounds.

Maximum Runes:

Half Runecraft Index

Engraving Time:

10 + (d6 days per rune)

Maximum Fate:

� FP

Rune Edifice : up to Runecraft Index runes are carved on an object too big or secure to be readily moved, such as a boulder, door frame, or ship's mast. Any number of people may attune to it. A rune edifice extends the range of proximate attunement to the crafter's Runecraft ML in feet.

Maximum Runes:

Runecraft Index

Engraving Time:

15 + (d6 days per rune)

Maximum Fate:

5 FP

## using runes

To benefit from runes, a person must attune to the object that displays them. Runecrafters automatically have bonded attunement with the rune objects they create. Others must establish it through one of the usual processes, usually by proximate attunement (page 208).

Attuned users may expend the object's Fate Points for Fate Rolls involving tests associated with any of the object's rune powers, as shown in the Rune Powers table (page 282). Specific tests are suggested, but the GM may include others that seem appropriate to the rune's general concepts. Once all the FP are spent, the object loses its rune powers and enchantment, severing all attunements.

## rune engraving example

A runecrafter engraves a ship's mast as a rune edifice with two rune powers: Ship and Weapon . The engraving time is 15 + 2d6 days (a 7 is rolled for 22 days). The ML75 crafter (Woodworking Index  4) rolls 61-Success (S)-and d10 roll 8-SR failure. This produces SV7 and a three-star result. Attuned crew within 75 feet of the mast can use the 3 FP on Seamanship, Shipwright, and Melee strike tests.

## starting engraved objects

Characters with at least Runecraft ML50 begin the game with any number of rune objects of any type whose total Fate Point installation equals half Runecraft Index.

## Rune Engraving

Runecraft skill grants the diviner the ability to share with others the arcane energies inherent to each runestone. These 25 Rune Powers, as shown on page 282, reflect the nature of the 18 universal Lifestones and the 7 cultural Kinstones.

Through a careful process, the runecrafter engraves a rune into a small piece of stone or wood, or sometimes onto the surface of another object, such as a sword blade or boulder. During this arcane procedure, the runecrafter makes special runecastings to help guide the infusion of the rune power into the given object. Afterwards, anyone attuned to the rune object gains an insight into their personal Fate with regard to the rune's specific power.

Creating rune objects is called engraving . The crafter needs tools appropriate to the engraved object (small chisels, hammers, knives), but no workshop is required.

[�] Rune Engraved Object : the runecrafter chooses an object to engrave-a rune piece, device, or edifice (see sidebar).

[�] Rune Power : for each rune engraved into the object, crafters select a rune power from their set of 25 runestones, up to the maximum number of runes allowed by the object, as given in the sidebar.

[�] Engraving Time : the crafter spends the indicated number of days engraving the object (about 10 hours per day). Much of this time is spent in meditation, in addition to the physical process of carving the runes. Rune Engraving requires concentration (page 182) only during the 10 hours of actual work on any given day.

[�] Engraving Roll : after spending the engraving time in step 3, the arcanist makes a Runecraft (Craft SR) Success Value test. For the Secondary Roll, use the Craft skill appropriate to the object surfaceMasonry, Metalcraft, or Woodworking. In addition to their esoteric qualities, Engraving Rolls are also technically physical tasks and so could be limited or prevented by injury impairment.

Craft SR : with a Runecraft success (S or CS), increase the resulting SV by � if the Craft SR also succeeds.

Trauma : any impairment to the hands and arms that would reasonably affect the crafting process applies to the Runecraft SV test.

## sv runecraft (craft sr) success value test

[�] Duration : a specific rune has an Indefinite duration-until it is dispelled (page 251), until the crafter cancels its enchantment, or until all of the rune object's FP are expended (see Using Runes in the sidebar).

## Tarotry

Tarotry lets an arcanist envision a querent's future by interpreting Pvaric ethereal energies through a tarot deck. Whereas astrology exhibits a long-term view of a querent's Fate-and runecraft, often a broad, fleeting glimpse of it-tarotry provides a focused look at the future. It also enables reader-querents to enhance the effect of their own incantations, and so tarotists very likely have some expertise themselves in spellcasting or invocation.

Tarotists have two core abilitiesTarot Reading and Tarot Incanting . They also share with all diviners a quality that enhances their own Fate RollsFate Attunement (sidebar).

## the génin tarot deck

Of the many versions created over the centuries, the deck attributed to the Melderyni mage Genin ( c . tr 490) is now used throughout all of Lythia, including among Ælrhin and Kuzhan diviners. A Genin deck consists of 72 cards: the 36 Minor Arcana and the 36 Major Arcana.

Minor Arcana : the 36 cards of the Minor Arcana are constructed out of six suits of six ranks each (sidebar).

Major Arcana : the 36 cards of the Major Arcana each have a unique card name and accompanying meaning. See The Génin Tarot table on the following page for more details, including how each Minor Arcana Suit and Major Arcana card relates to the Pvaric elements.

The cards themselves are not magical and do not require attunement; rather, the tarotist's ability lies in the skilful arcane interpretation of them. Certain traditions instead use marked sticks or dice, but, whatever the form, the divinatory effect is the same as long as a full set is used (price new: 40d). Missing cards or pieces must be replaced.

Tarot Reading and Tarot Incanting require the diviner to create a tarot spread with the deck. While nearly every culture has its own style, the most common is the hexal spread . The tarot spread is constructed inworld by the characters, not in-game by the players-but it would look much like that shown in the diagram in the sidebar and the image below.

<!-- image -->

## fate attunement

A character's Fate Roll ML is increased by an amount equal to the highest Index of Astrology, Runecraft, Tarotry, or Prescience.

## minor arcana cards

| suits     | ranks    |
|-----------|----------|
| Wands     | 1 Ace    |

| Flames    | 3 Page   |
| Pentacles | 4 Knight |
| Scrolls   | 5 Queen  |
| Cups      | 6 King   |

## the hexal spread

The 72 cards are shuffled and cut by the reader, with participation from the querent in some cases according to tradition or personal preference. The cards are placed face down and then dealt from the top and laid out in a hexagonal pattern of six cards. The cards are usually laid out on a simple tarot altar unique to the reader, such as a square piece of cloth on a chest or table. A single final card-called the Significator-is drawn and placed in the middle or set to the side. In the world, this is how many tarotists present the Hexal Spread:

## narrative tarotry

Similarly to the suggestion given about Astrology and Astromantic readings, a GM can include creative descriptions of what the tarot reader might utter during the reading. Apart from the impact of the game mechanics of the reading, this narration can further enrich the unfolding story of the campaign. Moreover, gaming groups might enjoy employing a physical deck of their own to demonstrate or enhance the entire process.

## Tarot Reading

When a querent seeks a tarot reading, the tarotist creates a spread and Pvarically examines the resulting cards for their implicit ethereal energy as signs of the querent's future. The process requires concentration (page 182) by both parties. Querents may be their own readers.

True Form : no character whose True Form is concealed may participate in tarot reading, as either reader or querent (page 209 sidebar).

[�] Reading Time and Cost : the tarotist spends one hour making the reading. Arcanists may charge 90d per reading (or 30d per star rating).

[�] Communication : the reader and querent's shared language complexity modifies the test: Index 0-2 (-10 penalty); Index 3-5 (0); Index 6-8 (+5 bonus); Index 9 or more (+10 bonus). Using a translator lowers these modifiers by 20. Without a shared language, translator, or telepathic communication (+20 bonus), the reading cannot take place.

[�] The Reading : test the reader's Tarotry on the Tarot Reading table. Trauma : as with all esoteric actions, fatigue penalty applies. Usually no other impairment applies.

[�] Significator : the diviner examines all seven cards; in-game the gist of the reading manifests as a single card called the significator.

To generate a significator, roll d12 and d6 on The Génin Tarot table (page 286). A CS Tarot Reading Roll allows the querent-player to generate two significators and then select the one most desired.

| d12   | The d12 result directs one either to a Suite row in the Minor Arcana (results 1-6 in the upper half of the table); or to a group of six cards in the Major Arcana (results 7-12 in the lower half).   |

| d6    | After locating the d12 result, the d6 roll determines either a Rank if the d12 result was in the Minor Arcana, or a Card Nameifthed12result was in the Major Arcana.                                  |

[�] Significator Result : the benefits of a successful reading depend on whether the Significator was in the Minor or Major Arcana:

| minor arcana   | For the next 30 days, all Fate Rolls involving a Fated skill from the Skill Group that corresponds to the Suit get a bonus equal to the Rank .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## tarot reading limitations

Reader : no tarotist can produce an accurate Tarot Reading for the same querent more often than once per 30 days-even if the reading failed.

Querent : the same querent benefits only from the reading with the highest success level within the last 30 days (break tied successes).

## reader true sight

A successful Tarot Reading Roll in step 3 (S or CS) reveals the querent's True Form (page 209 sidebar) to the reader.

## tarot reading examples

Example One : a Tarot Reading generates a successful (S) Tarotry test and, thus, one significator. The d12 roll of 4 gives Pentacles in the Minor Arcana. The d6 roll of 3 gives a Page. The significator is therefore the Page of Pentacles , and means that the querent receives for the next 30 days a +3 bonus to Fate Rolls when the Fated skill is from the Physical skill group.

Example Two : a Tarot Reading generates a critically successful (CS) Tarotry test-two significators. For the first one, the d12 roll of 2 and the d6 roll of 1 produce the Ace of Swords in the Minor Arcana (+1 to Craft Fated tests for the next 30 days).

For the second significator, the d12 roll of 8 refers to the second group in the Major Arcana. The d6 roll of 1 pinpoints The Wolf . This means the querent receives for the next 30 days a +5 bonus to Fate Rolls when the Fated skill is from the Craft skill group, and a +4 bonus to Fate Rolls when it is from the Nature skill group. The querent's player selects the second significator as the actual result.

The Wolf also increases by one success level a single Fate Roll made during the next 30 days when the Fated skill pertains to watchfulness or an ally, or to the element of metal. The GM and player should work out together when these meanings apply during game play. The player does not have to choose to apply this one-time increase until after the Fate Roll is made-and may choose not to apply it even if the Fated skill pertains to the Wolf concepts. Here are some suggestions of 'watchfulness', 'ally', and 'metal':

-  This most obviously could apply to a Fated Awareness test (watchfulness).
-  It could also be used on a Fated combat skill in defence of a friend, or on a social skill when seeking an alliance (ally).
-  It might find use with a test involving literal metal-the wielding of a sword or an exchanging of coins.

## significator: minor arcana

For 30 days, the tarotist receives an incanting benefit according to the Suit , for a number of times equal to Rank . Each benefit may only be applied once per spellcasting or invocation.

## minor arcana benefits

fatigue : reduce	fatigue	accrual	by	5.

- resistance : reduce	target's	opposed	Spirit	test	to resist	by	10.
- index : Increase the effective Index of the spell or talent	by	1	for	its	duration.
- gesture : Still	Gesture	allowed	at	no	penalty when casting a spell; or receive +10 bonus to Invocation if the incanting is a talent.
- expertise : receive +5 bonus to a Spellcasting or Invocation	Roll.
- cant : Silent	Cant	allowed	at	no	penalty	if	a	spell; or	receive	+10	bonus	to	Invocation	if	a	talent.

## significator: major arcana

For 30 days, the tarotist receives the incanting benefits that correspond to all the Convocations listed in the last three columns of the Major Arcana table. Each benefit is received a number of times equal to the number after the Convocation's abbreviation. A given benefit may be applied only once per incanting.

## major arcana benefits

f´yvria : Fatigue	(as	for	Minor	Arcana).

jmôrvi : Resistance	(as	for	Minor	Arcana).

pèleáhn : Index	(as	for	Minor	Arcana).

lyáhvi : Gesture	(as	for	Minor	Arcana).

sàvôrya : Expertise	(as	for	Minor	Arcana).

odívshè :	Cant	(as	for	Minor	Arcana).

## tarot incanting frequency

No tarotist can accurately perform Tarot Incanting more often than once per 30 days, no matter the success level.

## tarot incanting example

The Tarotry test of a Tarot Incanting is a Success (S), producing one significator. The d12 roll of 8 refers to the second group in the Major Arcana. The d6 roll of 1 pinpoints the significator within this group as The Wolf . This means the tarotist receives over the next 30 days Jmorvi's metal benefit to spellcasting (Resistance) five times, and Fyvria's earth benefit to spellcasting (Fatigue) four times.

## Tarot Incanting

Uniquely among divinations, tarotry can directly affect the tarotist's own spellcasting and invocation. The diviner performs Tarot Incanting just like a Tarot Reading-by constructing a spread and determining a significator. However, here, querents must be their own readers and must maintain concentration throughout the process.

[�] Astrological Modifier : incanters are never more astrologically aligned than during the Sunsign of their birth. Apply a modifier to the test, below, according to the date of the Tarot Incanting test in relation to their birth sunsign. Follow steps [3] and [4] of the Astromancy Routine (page 279) to compute this modifier .

[�] Time : the reader-querent spends 1 hour in the reading.

[�] Incanting : test the reader-querent's Tarotry on the Tarot Incanting table:

## tarot incanting

- cf No	effect	and	the	querent-reader	makes	a Will test;	any	failure	causes	a	roll for	Divinatory	Blindness	(page	275).
- f No	effect.
- s Generate	one	Significator.
- cs Generate	two	Significators.	Choose	one	and	ignore	the	other.

[�] Significator : generate the significator(s) by rolling d12 and d6 and consulting The Génin Tarot table in the same manner as in a Tarot Reading (step 4, page 287).

| d12   | The d12 result directs one either to a Suite row in the Minor Arcana (results 1-6 in the upper half of the table); or to a group of six cards in the Major Arcana (results 7-12 in the lower half).   |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| d6    | After locating the d12 result, the d6 roll determines either a Rank if the d12 result was in the Minor Arcana, or a Card Nameifthed12result was in the Major Arcana.                                  |

[�] Significator Result : the benefit to the reader-querent from a successful reading depends on whether the significator was in the Minor or Major Arcana (sidebar). Each benefit remains available until used within 30 days, or until 30 days have passed (if left unused).
