## Persona

While Birth information gives a broad cultural context (steps 1-5), and Family characteristics help explain parental and clan influence (steps 6-9), Persona describes a character's individual aptitude and unique development. It is largely defined through the following five elements.

Characteristics : characters have six physical and six mental Attributes that measure the innate talent of their body and mind. There are other characteristics to reflect morality and inherent psychic ability.

Occupation : characters select an occupation, either the same as their parents or a different one. They are usually restricted to those that appear on their society's Class &amp; Occupation table of a social class no higher than their parents'. The GM might allow exceptions for a unique backstory, or level even further restrictions, such as requiring a strong Aura to enter esoteric occupations.

Skills : the several dozen skills in the game measure a character's training in a specific endeavour; each is rated 0 to 100 or higher by a Mastery Level (ML). While Attributes influence a skill's score (and cap its ultimate development), sheer time and effort from training also affect mastery.

Standing : a character's money and possessions reflect both Family (inheritance) and Persona (occupation).

Mysteries : characters have the chance to shape their own destiny through the expression of the three Mysteries. It is especially glimpsed through astrological fate.

## Attribute Descriptions

The following two pages display the six physical and six mental Attributes.

Physical Attributes : Strength (STR), Endurance (END), Dexterity (DEX), Agility (AGL), Perception (PER), Comeliness (CML).

Mental Attributes : Aura (AUR), Will (WIL), Reasoning (REA), Creativity (CRE), Empathy (EMP), Eloquence (ELO).

A table for each one provides trait-like descriptions for the entire range of scores. These are a guide to how folk in the game world might describe the given attribute: a character with Agility 18 might be called graceful .

Attributes directly affect the Mastery Level (ML) of a skill-the average of two equals its Skill Base (SB), as further explained on page 45. Attributes may also be tested individually themselves with a d100 roll versus their  score times five.

Generating attribute scores and other characteristics begins on page 38 (step 10).

## character traits

In addition to the various numerical ratings, characters possess qualitative descriptions called Traits , applicable to both physique and personality. These can be assigned during character generation (Sunsign and Morality Traits); acquired during game play (a limp resulting from injury); suffered as mental trauma ( paranoid ); or simply created whole-cloth ( devoted to avenging a sibling's death).

Character traits are often not quantified. They remain narrative details the player expresses through roleplaying to whatever extent they wish. Psyche traits can also develop into more intense conditions called impulses or disorders -these can be acquired during character generation (page 40) or as the campaign unfolds (page 188).

How many total traits a character has is up to the player-two or three salient ones is a good start. A select few can often more clearly describe a character than a lengthy and perhaps muddled litany.

## physical attributes

| 1-4   | Feeble   |
|-------|----------|
| 5-8   | Weak     |
| 9-12  | Average  |
| 13-16 | Forceful |
| 17-20 | Mighty   |

Strength measures	physical	power,	the	majority	of which	stems	from	the	character's	body	mass	or	size. However,	a	slight	character	could	be	relatively	stronger than	someone	else	of	similar	height	and	weight.	The relationship of STR and END together describes a character's	body	type:	high	STR	and	low	END	could imply	someone	physically	large	but	overweight	or	out of	shape.

<!-- image -->

| 1-4   | Uncoordinated   |
|-------|-----------------|
| 5-8   | Awkward         |
| 9-12  | Average         |
| 13-16 | Deft            |
| 17-20 | Adroit          |

Dexterity gauges	hand	coordination-deftness-and the	sense	of	touch.	A	character	with	high	DEX	can readily	manipulate	objects,	whether	a	saw,	a	set	of	lock picks,	or	a	sword.	Those	with	low	DEX	are	ham-fisted and	lack	fine	motor	control.

<!-- image -->

| 1-4   | Impaired   |
|-------|------------|
| 5-8   | Dulled     |
| 9-12  | Average    |
| 13-16 | Sharp      |
| 17-20 | Acute      |

Perception represents	the	strength	of	a	character's eyesight,	hearing,	and	smell.	The	same	score	is	used	for all three separate senses (or each can receive its own score-EYE,	HRG,	SML;	see	the	sidebar	option	on	page 38).	The	sense	of	smell	is	less	differentiated	between individuals as an innate talent than sight and hearing are;	notable	distinction	usually	only	emerges	through the	development	of	specific	olfactory-based	skills.

<!-- image -->

| 1-4   | Frail   |
|-------|---------|
| 5-8   | Unfit   |
| 9-12  | Average |
| 13-16 | Robust  |
| 17-20 | Hardy   |

Endurance quantifies	stamina	and	overall	bodily health.	A	character	who	can	withstand	great	physical hardship	and	violent	shock	likely	has	high	END.	How quickly	one	recovers	from	illness	and	injury	also depends	on	it.	When	considered	along	with	STR,	END helps	define	a	character's	stature:	someone	with	low STR	and	high	END	could	be	short	or	slim	but	wirytough.

<!-- image -->

| 1-4   | Blundering   |
|-------|--------------|
| 5-8   | Clumsy       |
| 9-12  | Average      |
| 13-16 | Nimble       |
| 17-20 | Graceful     |

Agility determines	mobility	and	bodily	reflexes. A character with high AGL can dodge better and run	faster.	While	athleticism	relies	heavily	on	AGL, most	specific	Physical	skills	also	incorporate	other Attributes-DEX	affects	Climbing	and	STR	enhances Jumping,	for	instance.

<!-- image -->

| 1-4   | Ugly         |
|-------|--------------|
| 5-8   | Unattractive |
| 9-12  | Plain        |
| 13-16 | Attractive   |
| 17-20 | Striking     |

Comeliness expresses	physical	beauty,	as	measured according to the standards embodied in humans and the	Ælrhin.	While	there	is	general	agreement,	even across	disparate	cultures,	about	facial	attractiveness, the	effect	of	such	allure	on	'outsiders'	can	be	modified by	unique	cultural	fashion	and	accoutrement.	Thus, an	unfamiliar	hair	style	might	induce	a	penalty	to	the Charm	skill,	but	not	to	the	person's	CML	attribute.

<!-- image -->

| 1-4   | Mundane   |
|-------|-----------|
| 5-8   | Shallow   |
| 9-12  | Average   |
| 13-16 | Deep      |
| 17-20 | Profound  |

Aura indicates	a	character's	strength	of	soul	and directly	reflects	one's	connection	to	the	cosmic	allto Kelestia .	It	makes	possible	all	of	the	esoteric	arts, whether	channelling	and	resisting	spells,	invoking arcane	talents,	or	travelling	to	the	spirit	world.	Aura also,	and	perhaps	most	importantly,	measures	the	link between	one's	conscious	choice	of	action	and	fate.

<!-- image -->

| 1-4   | Dim       |
|-------|-----------|
| 5-8   | Dull      |
| 9-12  | Average   |
| 13-16 | Sharp     |
| 17-20 | Brilliant |

Reasoning quantifies	logic	and	memory.	Learned characters	usually	have	a	high	REA,	and	even	rustic	folk benefit	from	a	sharp	and	subtle	wit.	While	the	study	of the	arcane	arts	usually	requires	a	measure	of	reasoning, the	expression	of	magic	depends	more	on	one's intuitive,	natural	connection	to	it	through	Aura	(AUR).

<!-- image -->

| 1-4   | Unfeeling     |
|-------|---------------|
| 5-8   | Remote        |
| 9-12  | Average       |
| 13-16 | Understanding |
| 17-20 | Sensitive     |

Empathy describes	emotional	awareness.	What Perception	is	to	the	physical	senses,	Empathy	is	to	the social	senses.	A	character	with	high	EMP	more	correctly understands	another's	unspoken	motives	and	feelings, granting	a	better	defence	against	manipulation. Empathy	also	might	make	dissembling	easier	by helping characters to control their own emotions when under	scrutiny	or	judge	a	mark's	reaction	better.

<!-- image -->

| 1-4   | Submissive   |
|-------|--------------|
| 5-8   | Indecisive   |
| 9-12  | Average      |
| 13-16 | Resolute     |
| 17-20 | Implacable   |

Will reflects	tenacity	and	discipline.	It	enhances	a	wide variety	of	endeavours,	ranging	from	the	study	of	lore	to resolve	in	combat.	Most	importantly,	Will	serves	as	the mental	endurance	Attribute,	measuring	the	ability	to withstand	and	recover	from	stress	to	the	psyche.

<!-- image -->

| 1-4   | Banal       |
|-------|-------------|
| 5-8   | Predictable |
| 9-12  | Average     |
| 13-16 | Innovative  |
| 17-20 | Visionary   |

Creativity measures	imagination	and	quickness	of thought.	A	low	CRE	implies	a	turgid	mind,	less	capable of	generating	ideas	outside	familiar	norms.	Creativity interacts	with	other	Mental	Attributes,	such	as	REA	and ELO,	to	give	a	complete	picture	of	a	character's	overall intelligence.	In	combination	with	EMP	and	AUR,	CRE might	also	describe	a	person's	artistic	talent.

<!-- image -->

| 1-4   | Incoherent   |
|-------|--------------|
| 5-8   | Muddled      |
| 9-12  | Average      |
| 13-16 | Articulate   |
| 17-20 | Expressive   |

Eloquence reflects	communicative	talent,	facility	with language,	and	clarity	of	expression	(geniuses	can	very well	be	inarticulate).	High	ELO	could	reflect	to	a	certain extent	an	impactful	tone	or	sonorousness.	The	talent for	singing	is	largely	physiologically	independent of		one's	speaking	voice,	demanding	its	own	quasiAttribute,	Voice	(VOI).	See	sidebar,	page	49,	and Singing	skill,	page	84.

## physical attributes: age

Generate physical attributes by rolling an array of d6 according to the character's age group.

| agegroup   | dicearray                     |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| Young      | 5d6 (drop two lowest results) |
| Mature     | 4d6 (drop lowest result)      |
| Old        | 3d6                           |

-  Despite their greater age in years, Elder Folk roll the dice array that corresponds to their given age group-thus, Sinai PCs are young; Kuzhai PCs are mature.
-  These dice arrays are for player characters. Non-player characters are rolled at one step lower: Young 4d6 (drop lowest result); Mature 3d6; Old 4d6 (drop highest result).

## adult minimum attribute

Adult folk of all three age groups have a minimum attribute of 5 -only infants and the infirm or impaired have lower scores. Final dice results of � and � are automatically increased to � before adding Folk modifiers.

This rule helps scale folk to other creatures who have natural scores in the 1 to 4 range, such as birds (STR 2), snakes (REA 2), cats (STR 3), horses (AUR 4); and even exotic entities, such as elementals (ELO 1-3).

## attribute roll examples

Physical : a player generates the Strength of a young human character by rolling 5d6, dropping the lowest two results and adding the rest. If 1, 6, 3, 2, 3 are rolled, then STR equals 12 (the 1 and 2 are discarded).

Mental : a player generates the Aura of a Kuzhai character by rolling 4d6, dropping the lowest, and summing the result. If 1, 2, 1, 1 are rolled, then AUR equals 4 (one of the 1s is discarded). However, the 4 is raised to the adult minimum of 5, then reduced by the Kuzhai Folk Modifier of -2, down to a final AUR 3.

## three perception scores

When rolling three separate Perception scores for EYE, HRG, and SML, use the following Folk Modifiers in place of the single PER one:

| folk    |   eye |   hrg |   sml | folk   |   eye |   hrg |   sml |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Ænarin  |    +2 |    +1 |    +1 | Nadi   |    -2 |    -2 |    +2 |
| Kuzhai  |     0 |    +2 |     0 | Sidhe  |    +6 |    +4 |    +4 |
| Malakta |    +3 |     0 |    +2 | Sinai  |    +4 |    +3 |    +3 |

Refer to Subattributes (page 57) in Advice &amp; Options at the end of the chapter for further discussion of this approach.

## Characteristics

There are six core characteristics-Physical Attributes, Mental Attributes, Morality, Arcane Talent, Divine Grace, and Psyche.

<!-- image -->

Generate	Characteristics	through	the	following	six	sub-steps.

Random generation can provide interesting texture and inspiring outcomes. However, if players have a specific character concept in mind, they may switch, adjust, or reroll the results as they wish and as the GM allows (see page 57 for the Attribute Score Total option).

## [ � ] Physical Attributes

Physical attributes are the essential talents of a character's physique. To generate each physical attribute, sum the result of a dice array determined by the character's Age Group , as given in the table at the top of the sidebar. Roll the given array for each physical attribute, in order from Strength through Comeliness, one at a time. For all age groups, raise the result to the adult minimum of five if the roll is less.

Perception Attribute : by default, this is a single value that represents the same score for Eyesight (EYE), Hearing (HRG), and Smell (SML). However, the player group may prefer the option to generate a separate score for each of the three senses (see sidebar, bottom left).

Elder Folk Modifiers : after rolling the dice array, apply the following modifiers to the physical attributes of Elder Folk.

| attribute   |   ænarin |   kúzhai |   malákta |   nâdi |   sidhé |   sinái |
|-------------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| Strength    |        0 |       +2 |        +2 |      0 |       0 |       0 |
| Endurance   |        0 |       +2 |        +3 |      0 |       0 |       0 |
| Dexterity   |       +1 |       +1 |        +4 |     +2 |      +3 |      +2 |
| Agility     |       +1 |        0 |        +6 |      0 |      +3 |      +2 |
| Perception  |       +2 |       +1 |        +2 |      0 |      +5 |      +3 |
| Comeliness  |       +1 |        0 |         0 |     -2 |      +4 |      +2 |

## [ 2 ] Mental Attributes

Mental Attributes are the essential talents of a character's personality. To generate each mental attribute, add the result of 4d6 (drop lowest). All three age groups use this identical array, raising results of three or four to the adult minimum of five, just as for physical attributes. Non-player characters roll 3d6.

Elder Folk Modifiers : after rolling the dice array, apply the following modifiers to the mental attributes of Elder Folk:

| attribute   |   ænarin |   kúzhai |   malákta |   nâdi |   sidhé |   sinái |
|-------------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| Aura        |       +2 |       -2 |        -2 |      0 |      +6 |      +4 |
| Will        |       +1 |       +3 |        +3 |      0 |      +2 |      +2 |
| Reasoning   |        0 |        0 |        -1 |      0 |       0 |       0 |
| Creativity  |       +1 |        0 |        -2 |     +1 |      +3 |      +2 |
| Empathy     |       +3 |       -2 |        -2 |      0 |      +1 |      +2 |
| Eloquence   |       +1 |        0 |         0 |      0 |      +4 |      +3 |

S

## [ 3 ] Morality

Morality (MOR) measures selflessness, rated on a 1-20+ scale like other Attributes. Players may choose a Morality score or generate it randomly by rolling 4d6 and selecting any three dice to construct it. Make note of both the number and the corresponding Morality trait (as shown in bold, below). Certain Folk further modify the generated MOR score-of those discussed, only the Kuzhai (+2) and Sinai (+4) do so.

## mor trait &amp; description

- 1-4 Diabolical :	a	highly	narcissistic	person	who	finds	pleasure	in	sacrificing the	needs	and	well-being	of	others	for	personal	gain.	When	paired	with low	Empathy,	the	character	might	be	mindlessly	depraved;	with	a	high Empathy,	deviously	manipulative.
- 5-7 Unscrupulous :	a	self-centred	opportunist	rarely	troubled	by	guilt.	With low	Empathy,	the	plight	of	others	seldom	registers	or	matters;	with	high Empathy,	life	is	remorselessly	viewed	as	the	'survival	of	the	fittest'.
- 8-10 Corruptible :	impartial	to	the	needs	of	others,	and	more	often	inclined	to pleasure	or	profit.	The	lower	the	Empathy,	the	less	the	person	is	cognisant of	or	bothered	with	their	actions	adversely	affecting	others.
- 11-13 Dutiful : a person more interested in common fairness than deferring to individual	needs.	Dutiful	people	with	higher	Empathy	might	more	likely avoid	directly	and	unnecessarily	harming	others.
- 14-16 Principled :	a	generous	person	reluctant	to	cause	suffering	and	troubled by	guilt	when	it	happens.	With	a	lower	Empathy,	the	person	is	much	less self-aware	of	committing	an	occasional	'sin'	such	as	vanity	or	hatred.
- 17+ Exemplary :	a	completely	selfless	character	motivated	by	kindness	and self-sacrifice.	With	low	Empathy,	they	might	seem	priggish	or	removed; with	high	Empathy,	they	exude	a	generosity	mistaken	by	very	few.

These six traits are how others likely describe the character in the world ( an unscrupulous king ), even if the table entries reflect a more modern socio-psychological notion of altruism. GMs might restrict PC Morality, especially if a group is expected to function cohesively. One option is to disallow PC MOR below 8. The dynamic can also depend on how far apart the various scores are-some disparity can make the interaction between PCs more interesting. GMs may adjust PC scores in game if players establish a consistently contrary pattern of behaviour.

## purpose

The various Folk available as player characters all express Morality and can exhibit an individual Purpose. Players can describe Purpose in a single word, similar to the sunsign and Morality traits, or with a longer phrase ( restore the honour of my outcast clan ). A purpose could be intricately connected to the character's larger social milieu or, in contrast, might reflect a very personal psychological desire or emotion.

Not all characters have to express a purpose immediately. Players might wish to leave this element undefined at the start of the game-the campaign will likely allow a character's purpose to develop. Much of the very heart of a role-playing game is the exposition-the story-of the unfolding purpose of a character or group of characters.

For short descriptions of Purpose, players may write a few words in the Morality rows of the character sheet. Longer explanations could be kept in the Notes section on the back or in a separate document. Some players might enjoy not writing anything down, roleplaying a character's Purpose verbally and through their PC's actions.

## empathy

The interaction between Morality and Empathy explains a great deal about how a character functions with people and society-see the Morality traits descriptions.

## nolóra: characteristics

<!-- image -->

As a mature character, Nolora gets 4d6 drop lowest rolls for all Attributes, in order. The GM decides to have the player generate a single Perception (PER) score for all three senses.

The twelve rolls are given below. The player is satisfied with some of the results but considers rerolling because the exceptionally low Will clashes in her mind with Nolora's nononsense, hard-working Sunsign trait.

| rolled   |   rolled | rolled   |   rolled | adjusted   |   adjusted | adjusted   |   adjusted |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| str      |       12 | aur      |        7 | str        |         12 | aur        |          9 |
| end      |       15 | wil      |        5 | end        |         15 | wil        |         16 |
| dex      |       12 | rea      |       11 | dex        |         14 | rea        |         13 |
| agl      |       14 | cre      |       11 | agl        |         12 | cre        |         11 |
| per      |       11 | emp      |       14 | per        |         14 | emp        |         14 |
| cml      |       14 | elo      |        9 | cml        |         11 | elo        |         10 |

Before she starts over, the GM encourages the player to discuss some adjustments. She would prefer a higher PER (so trades this for the CML score) and would rather have better hand coordination (she swaps DEX and AGL).

The GM suggests the Attributes Score Total option, explained on page 57. The total of the Physical Attributes already equals 80, so they remain at their present scores. However, the sum of the six Mental attributes equals only 57, so 16 extra points are given to raise their total to the minimum 73. The player puts 11 into WIL (now 16), two into AUR (now 9), two into REA (now 13), and the final point into ELO (now 10). The final, adjusted attributes are given above right.

The player then generates the remaining four characteristics of step 10 on pages 39-40:

| morality   | 4d6 roll: (6), 6, 4, 5     | Principled 15                  |
|------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| talent     | d20 roll: 20 d100 roll: 55 | 1(-1) Arcane Talent Prescience |
| grace      | d20 roll: 13               | 0 Grace                        |
| psyche     | d20 rolls: 1, 4            | noPsyche Trait                 |

The Talent result of Prescience seems bizarre, given such a low AUR. However, the GM points out that perhaps this 'gift' stems from an ancient legacy simply passed down to Nolora, despite her own lesser arcane ability. The player enjoys this detail, as she likely never would have consciously planned such a wrinkle. Thus, despite Nolora's practical mentality, there is something quite profound beneath the surface.

## arcane talent generation

Generate each possessed talent by rolling d100 according to the character's Folk.

Psyche Example : a mature human rolls two separate d20s on the Psyche table: a 19 results in a 2; and an 18 results in a 1-for a sum of 3. On the Psyche Result table, a sum of 3 gives the character one Psyche Impulse. A d10 roll of 8 indicates Paranoid .

## [ 4 ] Arcane Talent

Some people possess naturally occurring magical abilities called Arcane Talents (page 259). While those with a high Aura are more likely to have them, talents may appear in anyone. To determine whether a character has such innate power, compare a d20 roll with the character's Aura on the Talent Possession table (the key below it explains the results).

1 dp or 2 dp : the character adds the given number of Development Points (DP) to the	Spirit	skill	(see	Arcane	Talent	Skills	at	the	top	of	page	47).

1 (-1) or 1 (0) : the character receives one d100 roll on the Arcane Talent Generation table	in	the	sidebar,	and	the	talent	has	the	indicated	Dormancy Modifier	(0	or	-1).	The	character	also	adds 2 DP	to	the	Spirit	skill.

1 to 8 : the character receives the given number of d100 rolls on the Arcane Talent Generation table	(sidebar).	Each	dice	roll	grants	1	DP	to	the	resulting	Talent	(thus, rolling	Enthral	twice	equals	2	DP).	The	character	also	adds 2 DP	to	the	Spirit	skill.

## [ 5 ] Divine Grace

The Gods of Kelestia are removed from direct and obvious intervention in the lives of Kethirans. Deities answer the calls for miracles very rarely, subtly, and only if they come from those on whom they have bestowed a divine connection. Believers call this link a 'state of grace'.

Determine if characters have such Grace by rolling a d2o on the Grace table in the sidebar. The result generates their starting Grace points. Characters may also acquire and increase Grace during the campaign by completing quests, pilgrimages, and sacrifices. Being Marked increases the chance later of acquiring the first point of Grace. See Chapter 6: The Mysteries (page 311) for more explanation.

## [ 6 ] Psyche

Characters may have acquired a permanent Psyche trait during their life prior to the start of the campaign. Young human characters roll one d20 on the Psyche table in the sidebar; mature characters roll two separate d20s; and old roll three separate d20s.

Elder Folk : roll one d20 for Kuzhai and Malakta; and four d20s for Sinai. Nadi roll as for humans.

Add the results and consult the Psyche Result table to determine the number and intensity of psyche traits the character possesses. Then roll or choose the specific trait or traits from the Psyche Traits table. See Stress in Chapter 5: Adventure for more details (page 188).

## Occupation

The occupation players choose for their characters is one that many members of Kethiran societies might follow-weaponcrafter, mercantyler, pilot, man-at-arms, hunter. It could also be a seemingly more mundane vocation, such as farmer, herder, or mason; or even an esoteric one, like astrologer or shaman. What separates PCs from NPCs, therefore, is not the name of their profession nor the skills learned therein, but the nature of the actions they ultimately choose in pursuit of their more restless, and perhaps dangerous, ambition.

## Select	a	Character	Occupation.

Players select an occupation for their characters from among those available on the Class &amp; Occupation table that corresponds to their Society (pages 27-32). It can be the same as their parents' or a different one, and some GMs dictate it must correspond to a social class no higher than their parents', especially in the case of Noble occupations. However, characters could pursue a vocation not common to their society or class to reflect a unique backstory, such as a tribal hunter becoming a mercenary or a peasant joining the Shek Pvar.

The Occupations table on the following three pages lists all the available occupations in the same format, shown below. At this step, players should simply consider which occupation seems broadly inspirational or interesting-the numbers next to the skill names are explained and applied later. New players may wish to familiarise themselves with the Skill Development section before actually selecting the character's occupation (see step 12 on page 45).

## shèk-pvâr and priests

Players selecting the Shek-Pvar or Priest occupation for their characters should review the special steps and commentary on pages 54 and 55.

## feudal nobility

Not every noble is knighted and landed. Although it ranges greatly among cultures, a typical Feudal society enfeoffs about half the total number of noble heads of household, with a third of the rest remaining even unknighted. While all nobility are termed 'gentlefolk', these unlanded, unknighted nobles are called Gentry, and their occupations vary.

The Feudal Class &amp; Occupations table displays these sundry pursuits, such as Gentry (Arcanist) or Gentry (Mercenary). Gentry (Courtier) live entirely off the wealth of their family- 'professional' members of the nobility (perhaps the profligate sons or daughters). Usually, only characters who generate a Noble Parent Class in step 6 may select the Courtier or Knight Bachelor occupations, but the GM may allow non-gentlefolk to do so if a unique backstory calls for it.

## inherited titles

Characters with the Parent Occupation of Enfeoffed Manor Lord or Tenant-in-chief have a chance to be in direct line to inherit the family title and land. Determine this by rolling d100 against a title number based upon the character's Estrangement (left table):

| estrangement   |   title | agegroup   | title   |
|----------------|---------|------------|---------|
| Outcast        |      02 | Young      | 10      |
| Unpopular      |      04 | Mature     | 25      |
| Accepted       |      08 | Old        | 80      |
| Popular        |      17 |            |         |
| Favourite      |      35 |            |         |

If the roll is equal to or below the number, then a second d100 is rolled against the title number according to Age Group (right table). If also equal to or less, the roll means the character starts the campaign as the inheritor of the title: Enfeoffed Manor Lord or Tenantin-chief is the character's occupation . When only the first roll succeeds, the character is simply in line to inherit the title from a still-living relative.

## appointed manor lords

The positions of Sheriff, Constable, Bailiff of the Hundred, and (manor) Bailiff are usually held by nobility, but they are not inheritable. Characters may only begin the game with one as their occupation if designated so by the GM.

## nolóra: occupation

Having generated a Parent Occupation of hunter, the player selects hunter as Nolora's own Occupation, as well. Her high Endurance, Perception, and Will scores make her wellsuited for such a rugged vocation. The familial legacy will also boost several key skills.
