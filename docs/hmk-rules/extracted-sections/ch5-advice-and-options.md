# Advice & Options

## allies

Offset	a	defender's	Outnumbered	Penalty	by	10	for	each	ally	of	the defender	that	also	threatens	a	foe	threatening	the	defender.	Count each	foe	only	once	for	this	modification,	no	matter	how	many	allies threaten	the	same	foe;	and	each	ally	can	be	referenced	only	once.

Combatant 1 is	threatened	by	five	foes ( 4 -8 )	for	a	-40	Outnumbered	Penalty. Ally 2 threatens foes 4 and 5 but can offset	only	one	(foe 4 is	chosen).	Ally 3 threatens foes 5 and 6 but can offset only	one	(foe 5 is	chosen).	Foes 6 -8 give a	final	Outnumbered	Penalty	of	-20.

Combatants	have 1-space RCH . None are prone or Ignored.

## deadly attacks

Unaware	and	helpless	targets	are	especially	vulnerable	to	deadly melee	attacks.	Here	is	a	brief	summary	for	reference:

Unaware targets	must	select	the	Ignore	defence.	Examples	of	being unaware	include	being	Incapacitated	(INC),	failing	to	see	the	attack coming,	concentrating	elsewhere,	and	voluntarily	choosing	to	Ignore.

Helpless targets	must	select	the	Ignore	defence	and	automatically suffer	the	four-star	CS	result	from	melee	attacks.	Foes	who	elect	to concentrate	for	one	round	before	the	melee	attack	choose	the	strike location	without	ZD	or	LD	rolls.	Targets	are	helpless	if:	unconscious, sleeping,	paralysed,	blinded,	bound,	or	held	at	weapon-point.

## flanking

Worsen	a	defender's	Outnumbered	Penalty	by	10	when	at	least	one pair	of	foes	are	exactly	180°	from	each	other	around	the	defender. Apply	this	Flanking	Penalty	only	once,	even	with	multiple	such	pairs.

Combatant 1 is	threatened	by	five	foes ( 4 -8 )	for	a	-40	Outnumbered	Penalty. Both paired foes 4 and 7 and paired foes 5 and 8 flank	combatant	1.	Flanking worsens	Outnumbered	Penalty	only once	no	matter	how	many	pairs,	so	the final	Outnumbered	Penalty	is	-50.

Combatants	have 1-space RCH . None are prone or Ignored.

Allies and Flanking :	when	using	both	options,	compute	the	effect	of each	independently.	In	the	above	example,	the	Allies	option	offsets the	-40	penalty	by	20,	but	Flanking	worsens	it	by	10,	for	a	final	-30.

Flanking Awareness :	combatants	who	are	newly	flanked	by	a	foe must succeed on an immediate Awareness test or be unaware of the	new	flanker,	whom	they	must	Ignore.	Such	combatants	remain unaware	until	after	the	ignored	enemy	has	attacked	them	or	they succeed on an Awareness test (retest each round on the flanker's turn).

## melee maximum foe option .

Characters	may	threaten	and	defend	against	only three known	foes in	melee.	Outnumbered	Penalty	still	applies	to	these	three,	but	each foe	beyond	the	third	cannot	be	threatened	and	must	be Ignored . Characters	only	need	designate	such	'active'	foes	the	instance	the limit	is	exceeded	(note	the	IR);	but,	once	doing	so,	the	designation lasts	for	one	round,	or	until	the	limit	is	no	longer	exceeded.

Pass Action :	characters	who	Pass	on	their	turn	may	threaten	and actively	defend	against four foes	until	the	start	of	their	next	turn. Outnumbered	Penalty	still	applies	normally	to	these	four.

## advice &amp; options: adventure

## unique injury effects option

Consider	these	optional	unique	injury	effects.

Face Injuries : determine a Face sublocation with the d20 roll at the bottom of the Body Location table	(page	167).	The eyes and nose have Location	Shock	5	rather	than	4,	as	shown	in	the	table.

Apply	Serious	and	Grievous	injury	effects	by	sublocation-eye affects	only	vision;	mouth,	only	speaking;	and	so	forth.	Cheek	injuries might	not	impair	actions	or	movement,	just	Eloquence.	Grievous	face injuries	might	affect	social	skill	tests	with	a	special	-20	penalty.

Groin Injuries :	LN 9	in	the	Pelvis	is	a Groin sublocation	(SHK 5).

Serious Leg or Torso : one Serious	leg	or	torso	injury	prevents	the double	Move	rate; two or more prevent	full	and	double	Move	rates.

Grievous Leg : a single Grievous	leg	injury	still	allows	for	a	Difficult Half	Move	crawl;	or	a	Half	Move	walk	with	crutches	or	support.	One such	injury	allows	for	a	Melee	test	with	a	-20	penalty	but	then	forces a	Stumble	Roll	in	addition	to	all	other	outcomes.

Grievous Torso : a single Grievous	torso	injury	allows	for	a	Difficult Half	Move	crawl-but	not	two	or	more	such	injuries.

## weapon damage

Weapons have a Weapon Quality (WQ)	from	8	to	14,	which	both	the Weaponcraft	skill	and	enchantments	can	augment.	When	a	strike	is Blocked due	to	a	tie,	break	the	tie.	The	winner	of	this	tiebreak	rolls	the strike	impact	of	the	weapon	used	in	the	opposed	Blocked	attack.

- Increase	strike	impact	by	5	when	the	Weapon	Damage	roll	results from	winning	a	CS	tiebreak.
- Increase	strike	impact	by	5	when	striking	a	shield.
- Decrease	strike	impact	of	Thrust	(T)	weapons	by	5.
- Decrease	strike	impact	of	a	natural	weapon	versus	an	armed weapon	by	5	(see	page	171	sidebar	for	Blocks	that	involve	natural weapons).	A	natural	weapon	block	of	a	natural	weapon	attack instead	receives	actual	impact-see	Limb	Block	(page	106).

Compare	the	final	strike	impact	to	the	target	weapon's	current	WQ:

- If impact exceeds WQ ,	then	reduce	the	target	weapon's	WQ	by	one.
- If impact exceeds double WQ ,	then	the	target	weapon	is	destroyed.

Each WQ loss below the base WQ	reduces	the	weapon's	impact	by one.	Thus,	a	masterworked	WQ 13	broadsword	does	not	suffer	impact reduction	until	it	suffers	Weapon	Damage	below	its	base	WQ12.

Example :	an	ML60	attacker	wields	a	broadsword	(WQ13,	d10 + 5 e ) and an ML60 defender carries mace and roundshield (WQ10). The attacker strikes and rolls 35 (CS); the same defender blocks with the shield, rolling 25 (CS). The	strike	fails	because	Blocks	automatically	win	tied	successes.	However, for purposes of Weapon Damage, the CS tie is broken: the attacker wins, so	the	shield	might	suffer	weapon	damage.	The	attacker	rolls	d10 + 5 e + 5 (target	is	shield) + 5	(from	the	sword	CS)-a	roll	of	6	imparts	21	impact, more than twice WQ. The blow completely destroys the shield.

Metal Armour :	an	edge	or	point	aspect	melee	strike	against	metal armour	(scale,	mail,	or	plate)	that	results	in	negative	effective	impact (page	167,	step	2)	causes	a	Weapon	Damage	roll	against	the	striking weapon.	Roll	d6 + the	absolute	value	of	the	effective	impact	against the	weapon's	WQ	(resolve	the	damage	result	as	above).

Example : a WQ13 sword rolls 7 e strike impact against an AV17 location protected	by	plate.	The	sword	suffers	a	d6 + 10	Weapon	Damage	roll.
