# Gateways

## Gateways

A gateway is a type of energy force that transfers an entity from one point in the physical world to another point. For beings, it is thought that gateways transport the Aura-connection to the body, removing the anchor at the starting point and then instantaneously reforming it at the destination, where the body reappears. Two gateway types known to folklore are Barasi Points and Godstones .

## Barási Points

Named after the mage who studied them centuries ago, Barasi Points link naturally occurring channels between worlds. He described three types of such 'filaments':

Fixed : the starting and ending points are currently anchored to a spot in a physical landscape. Fixed Barasi Points are the only type that remain stable enough for Kethiran esotericists to manipulate directly.

Semi-fixed : one end of the filament remains in place but the other end is loose. Seemingly only the Earthmasters have been able to harness and guide Semi-fixed Barasi Points, and only from the fixed end (see Godstones, below).

Unfixed : both ends are unanchored, undetectable by any means known on Kethira. Some filaments become briefly and intermittently anchored at one end long enough for folk chancing upon them to suffer sudden transferral.

Barasi Points are invisible in the physical world, and only fixed ones can be detected with the Survey spell (page 254); or both detected and employed with the Transference talent (page 264). Mages cast the Gate spell (page 252) to 'hijack' an anchored end to force the filament to seek out a terminus projected by the caster.

## Godstones

Immobile grey monoliths scattered throughout much of Kethira, Godstones are the most indelible objects supposedly left by the ancient Earthmasters. Made of a seemingly indestructible material scholars call pseudostone , they can transfer beings to other locations or other worlds. Barasi theorised Godstones consisted of a multitude of fixed and semi-fixed Barasi Points that the Earthmasters 'bundled' together in a stable nexus of the edifice.

When a Godstone is dormant (closed), all of it appears completely grey; when active (open), the centre section on one side turns utterly black. A living entity may freely pass through an open Godstone and immediately appear at the destination. Up to half Spirit ML pounds of carried or worn clothing and gear will accompany the traveller-excess objects are left behind (this is the rule of Consonance, page 209). For this calculation, minor artefacts and major artefacts with Ego volition are considered objects ('gear'). Major artefacts with Will volition have their own Aura and thus calculate their own Consonance separately.

Interaction : the GM may allow characters unfamiliar with Godstones to test Folklore , with any Esoterica Group skill designated as a Secondary Modifier (often Spirit). Success means the character knows how to interact with the structure-whether open or closed-through a Godstone Operation Roll . There are five Godstone operations, but one must first successfully concur before trying the others:

## godstone operations

| concur   | While touching the Godstone, the character establishes concurrence, which then lasts until the character steps through the Godstone, ceases touching it, or fails one of the other operation rolls.          |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| close    | Aconcurred character closes an open Godstone.                                                                                                                                                                |
| open     | Aconcurred character opens a closed Godstone.                                                                                                                                                                |
| read     | Aconcurred character learns the Godstone's destination (no matter whether it is open or closed). For locations never visited, characters glean simply a visual description (no actual world or place names). |
| set      | Aconcurred character sets an open Godstone's destination. Refer to the GatewayDestination Modifiers table and text (page 155) for information.                                                               |

- An operation CF also means the Godstone closes and	sets	to	a	random	destination	(page	155).
- An	operation	F	also	means	the	Godstone	closes.

Each operation requires the character to test Spirit as a 1-turn action. Each attempt is potentially fatiguing:

|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| cf             | Godstone operation fails; character suffers d3 Aural Shock (page 190); retry allowed uponrecovery. |        15 |
| f              | Godstone operation fails; retry allowed.                                                           |        10 |
| s              | Godstone operation succeeds.                                                                       |         5 |
| cs             | Godstone operation succeeds.                                                                       |         0 |

Fatigue	accrues	as	windedness	(page	176	sidebar).

## Godstone Settings

Barasi speculated that Godstones are a bundle of many fixed and semi-fixed filaments. The GM may roll on the following tables to determine a Godstone's characteristics.

[�] Status : a Godstone may be closed; or open to another Godstone or non-Godstone location.

| d100   | status                      | filament type   |
|--------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| 01-35  | Closed                      | Fixed           |
| 36-75  | OpentoGodstone              | Fixed           |
| 76-00  | OpentoLocation (open space) | Semi-fixed      |

[�] Destination : determine the destination world of a Godstone by rolling d100 on the column corresponding to the world it resides on, such as keth , for Kethira.

When characters attempt the Set Godstone Operation, modify the test according to the residing world and the intended destination, and the other factors listed below.

Transference :	setters	receive	their	Transference	Index	as	a	bonus.

Creativity :	setters	must	include	their	Creativity	Secondary	Modifier.

Open Space :	-20	penalty	if	the	destination	is	not	a	Godstone.

Experience :	-20	penalty	if	the	setter	has	never	visited	the destination	location	in	the	physical	world	or	sensed	its corresponding	astral	locale	(page	293)	in	the	spirit	world.

If Spirit EML is reduced to 0 or less, then the character is incapable of even attempting the given Operation roll.

[�] Kèthîran Destination : determine the destination of a Godstone on Kethira by rolling d100. The resulting Godstone is shown on the Venârivè Godstones map on page 156 (the great majority of them on Kethira seem to be concentrated here). Use the special number-letter ID in the third column below to help locate it on the map.

## metamorphosis

When characters use a Godstone to travel between worlds, their bodies rematerialise in a form that allows them to survive and function in the new environment-perhaps in a radically different guise than on their home world. Godstones seem to possess an intelligence that accurately perceives these necessities. For instance, a character appearing on an 'air world' might take form as a flying creature or perhaps even as an air elemental.

On the other hand, such metamorphoses can also curtail some powers. Mages travelling to worlds weaker in magic than Kethira find their arcane abilities concomitantly reduced, if not entirely eliminated. This applies to items and technology, as well-magic swords and firearms very likely do not both function on the same world in the same epoch.

## godstone operation example

Elben stands before a Godstone that he understands to be open-its centre is utterly black. He touches it and attempts to concur . Against Spirit ML70, the roll is 37-Success (5 fatigue). Pressed for time, he immediately attempts to set its destination for the familiar alley behind his home in Cherafir. The Spirit test is against EML45 (70 - 5 fatigue + 0 CRE Secondary Modifier - 20 open space destination on Kethira). The roll is 41-Success. He then steps through and arrives in the alley with a total 10 windedness fatigue.
