## The Mysteries

One way characters connect to Kelestia (the cosmic all) is through Fate, a concept astrologers specialise in studying and interpreting.

<!-- image -->

Record 5 starting Fate	Points	and	the	Fate	Roll	ML	(sidebar).

Characters start with 5 Fate Points (FP). They lose them as a result of Fate Rolls, and gain them back through routine recovery and by participating in various divinatory practices. While FP may fluctuate throughout the campaign, they never go below 0. See page 276 in Chapter 6: The Mysteries for complete details.

After recording Fate Points, make note of any special rules for skills and abilities pertaining to the Arcane, Astral, or Divine Mysteries:

## arcane mysteries

The arcane mysteries involve the wielding of magic.

Alchemy : consult the Alchemy section (page 265) for rules concerning the creation of magic elixirs and for specific descriptions of each magic concoction. See Starting Elixirs (page 269 sidebar) to determine how many elixirs an alchemist has already made at character generation.

Arcane Talent : each Arcane Talent is its own skill. Review the general invocation rules (page 259) and then each Talent's specific description (pages 261-264).

Divination : the three divination skills each express unique applications. See Divination (page 275) and the respective section for each skill: Astrology (page 277), Runecraft (page 281), and Tarotry (page 285).

Shèk-Pvâr : characters with Pvarism ML require the most preparationsee the detailed steps on the next page.

## astral mysteries

Astral mysteries seek power from the spirit world.

Reverie : Ælrhin can enter trance-like states (page 308).

Trance : tribal shamans use the Trance skill to embark on astral journeys (page 290). While in the spirit world, they petition entities for subtle powers they can express back in the physical world. At the start of the game, shamans have just recently completed a successful astral journey-the player may select Spirit Powers whose levels do not exceed their character's Spirit Index (page 300).

## divine mysteries

Divine mysteries explore the enigma of the gods.

Grace : the rare character possessing Grace has been selected by the gods for divine intervention (page 311). A character 'marked' for Grace does not yet possess it but is more likely to receive it during the game through their deeds. In either case, the player now selects one of twelve aspects (page 310) to be associated with its bestowal or mark.

Ritual : characters usually begin with Ritual ML in a single religion. The religions of the West Venarian Pantheon are presented as examples (page 321), as is the Cult of the Covenant (page 343). See also the special steps on page 55 to calculate the character's starting Blessing Bonus and Piety.

## fate roll ml

Here are the most common Fate Roll MLs, based on the PC's Aura (AUR) attribute score:

| aur   | fate roll   | aur   | fate roll   |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 4-5   | ML35        | 14-15 | ML60        |
| 6-7   | ML40        | 16-17 | ML65        |
| 8-9   | ML45        | 18-19 | ML70        |
| 10-11 | ML50        | 20-21 | ML75        |
| 12-13 | ML55        | 22-23 | ML80        |

## fate &amp; npcs

While fate and destiny are a reality for all people in the game world, only player characters receive Fate Points as a game mechanic. It is assumed that the dice rolls a GM makes for an NPC already encompass the effect of fate in their numerical result.

## nolóra: fate

<!-- image -->

Nolora begins with 5 Fate Points. With an Aura score 9, she has a Fate Roll ML45. Fate Points can help her escape an otherwise lethal wound or mitigate some other disaster. While not finite, FP are precious and not failproofNolora's ultimate destiny is unknown.

## the nature of beings

Players should have a general grasp of the terms used to describe how their characters fit into the larger reality of the game universe. The various folk, such as humans and Sinai, are considered a kind of living entity called a being . Beings have a body in the physical world connected to a soul in the spirit world.

Throughout most of a being's life, a personality inhabits the body in the physical world. Personality consists of the six mental attributes, the skills derived from these mental attributes, and the various traits, such as morality and psyche. The body inhabited by this personality consists of a physique -the six physical attributes and skills, and the various appearance traits, such as eye colour and height. Physique also includes the special characteristics like movement style (walking, flying, swimming) and scent ability.

While inhabiting the body in this way, the being's perspective is in the physical world; and the soul is dormant in the spirit world, a state akin to spiritual 'unconsciousness'. Even while dormant, the soul is anchored to the body through the Aura attribute, extending beyond the body by about a foot. Certain esoteric measures enable beings briefly to transfer their personality from the body in the physical world to their active soul in the spirit world, thus switching perspective to the astralscape .

Pvârism ML

## spell selection example

A mature Savoryan mage with Pvarism ML84 receives 42 ARP (84 × 0.5 = 42). These are used to select known spells, although most Pvarists also freely receive three Neutral spells (step 7). The Spell Research Capability table on page 205 says that with at least Pvarism ML80 a mage may select Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Neutral spells. The home chantry is three-star Xerium in Hepekeria.

Harmony (Savorya I; Primary): selected for 1 ARP (CL1 + CD0).

Beam (Lyahvi IV; Secondary): selected for 5 ARP (CL4 + CD1).

Animus (Fyvria V; Tertiary) selected for 9 ARP (CL5 + CD3 + 1). The extra ARP is due to the threestar Savorya home chantry being one star less than the optimal four-star chantry for learning Tertiary spells (Chantry Resources, page 205).

These three spells cost 15 ARP , leaving only 27 ARP to spend on other spells or artefacts. Spells beyond the Primary convocation of even mid-range complexity are relatively expensive for all mages save the eldest of great skill.

## artefact example

The first artefact created by most Shek-Pvar is an elemental focus . It grants a bonus to Casting Rolls in the Primary and Secondary Convocations. Here are the procedures and ARP costs involved in creating a minor artefact focus:

-  The mage selects an elemental object (step 1, right). For instance, Savorya objects are usually related to and placed near the mind's eye (headband or turban) or the heart (pendant).
-  The mage spends 5 ARP to acquire the Focus spell (page 252).
-  The mage spends 6 ARP to acquire the Vessel spell (page 255).
-  The mage then spends 1 ARP to enchant a casting Success (S) into the object, making it an elemental focus. The mage can instead spend 10 ARP to enchant it with a casting Critical Success (CS). See the Focus entry to calculate the resulting bonuses.
-  The mage crafts the artefact in consort to give it a Permanent duration so that it cannot be dispelled. The final, total ARP spent is 12 (casting Success version) or 21 (casting Critical Success version).

## Shèk-Pvâr Characters

To finish generating a Shek-Pvar character, review the Shek-Pvar section on page 195 of Chapter 6, and then complete these eight steps.

[1] Convocation Affinity : select the mage's Primary Convocation and the resulting Secondary, Tertiary, and Diametric Convocations (page 195). The mage starts with an attuned elemental object (page 201 sidebar).

[2] Home Chantry : determine the mage's home Shek-Pvar chantry (page 197), noting its Star Quality (1 to 5). Chantries vary by Primary Convocation and will likely be close to the character's birth realm.

[3] Convocation Mastery Levels : calculate a Convocation ML for each of the six elemental Convocations and for Neutral (page 198).

[4] Guild Rank : determine the mage's rank in the Shek-Pvar (page 199). This is a function of age, Pvarism ML, and even politics-the GM helps determine the character's ultimate rank. Young mages are usually senior apprentices ( Satia Mavar ); Mature mages, journeymen ( Shenava ); and Old veteran journeymen or masters ( Viran ).

[5] Spell Research Capability : determine the Convocations the mage may study, either assisted or unassisted. This is called Spell Research Capability, a function of Pvarism ML (page 205).

[6] Arcane Research Points : calculate Arcane Research Points (ARP) according to the mage's Age Group and Pvarism ML (sidebar). Players spend ARP in steps 7 and 8. Once character generation ends, ARP are ignored; later arcane research follows the rules on page 205.

[7] Spells : all Shek-Pvar with at least Pvarism ML40 automatically know the spells Detect (Neutral I), Reveal (Neutral II), and Dispel (Neutral II). Spend the ARP calculated in step 6 to acquire additional known spells. The cost in ARP equals the spell's Difficulty (page 200 sidebar); calculate each spell's Mastery Level as shown there, too.

Chantry : the home chantry's Resources might modify ARP cost for spells requiring assisted research (page 205).

Natural Attunement : if the mage has Natural Attunement (page 262), halve the ARP cost of Primary Convocation spells (retain fractions).

Dimension Spells : these are more difficult to learn (page 249 sidebar).

[8] Artefacts : a minor artefact holds one enchantment; a major artefact holds two or more enchantments-see page 256 and page 257 for a complete explanation of artefact creation. The mage can spend ARP in the following manner to have already constructed artefacts:

Artefact Creation Spells : the mage spends 6 ARP to know Vessel (Neutral IV), the spell required to construct artefacts (page 255). To construct major artefacts, the mage must also know False Soul (5 ARP), Investment (7 ARP), or Personality (8 ARP).

Enchantments : mages must know the spell or spells that will be enchanted in each artefact. These will have been acquired in step 7.

For 1 ARP, mages create a minor artefact as if all Casting Rolls were a Success (S). For 10 ARP, they create one as if all Casting Rolls were a Critical Success (CS). Double these amounts if it is a major artefact (2 ARP or 20 ARP). Repeat these expenditures for each separate artefact.

For character generation purposes, all artefacts have been crafted in consort (page 256, step 1). This allows them to have either an Indefinite or a Permanent duration, as chosen by the mage.

## Religion and Priest Characters

Characters establish their status in the church pertaining to one of their Ritual skills, usually their highest ML or the one giving them the highest Piety (below). See the sidebar for considerations pertaining to Priests.

## church status

Characters with Ritual ML are called Followers in the corresponding religion, most often as laity (see Church Hierarchy, page 315). Followers can be in a sponsored fighting order if they have at least Melee and Initiative ML50 and Ritual ML20. Those with Priest, tribal Invoker, or Shaman occupations and at least Ritual ML20 may be clergy .

| followertype   | ritualml   | circle   | ceremony   |
|----------------|------------|----------|------------|
| Laity          | 1 +        | •        | Low        |
| Fighting Order | 20-39      | I        | LoworMid   |
|                | 40+        | II       | LoworMid   |
| Clergy         | 20-29      | I        | Low        |
|                | 30-59      | II       | LoworMid   |
|                | 60+        | III      | High       |

Ritual ML :	the	Follower's	Ritual	ML	in	the	religion.

Circle : the Circle of Command attained during character generation according to Follower	type	and	Ritual	ML.	The	religions	of	the	Western	Venarian	pantheon	are described	starting	on	page	321;	the	Cult	of	the	Covenant,	page	343.	There	review	the religion's Church Hierarchy table	for	special	rules	concerning	circles	and	offices. If	the	religion	includes	offices,	assume	characters	have	attained	one	available	at their	Circle	or	one	lower,	as	the	player	wishes,	and	the	GM	approves.

Ceremony :	the	highest-level	ceremony	the	Follower	may	attend.	Most	religions have	only	Low	and	High	ceremonies	(but	Agrik	has	a	Mid).

## other religious characteristics

Compute the following characteristics associated with the Divine Mysteries. See the page 319 sidebar for an additional summary.

Blessing Bonus : Followers begin with a Blessing Bonus equal to Ritual Index + 1 (Ritual Index equals ritual ML divided by 10, rounded down). The bonus lasts until the date of the next related ceremony (page 316).

Piety : Followers start with a maximum Piety equal to Circle + 1. Spent Piety can be restored to maximum by attending ceremonies.

Doctrinal Subjects : the Blessing Bonus modifies the tests of a number of Doctrinal skills or rolls-called Subjects -equal to maximum Piety . Subjects are listed in the Doctrine section in the first page sidebar of the religion's description in Chapter 6: Mysteries , starting on page 323. For the Cult of the Covenant pantheon, see page 343.

Doctrinal Subjects are divided by Ceremony Level (Low, Mid, or High). Followers may select the Subjects from among those accorded to the highest ceremony level they may attend, and from any of those of a lower level. See the two Church Status examples in the sidebar.

Morality : each religion expresses an orthodox range of Morality (MOR) scores. For each point a character's MOR diverges from the closest end of this range, reduce maximum Piety by 1 (down to a minimum 0). For instance, the Laranian faith has an orthodox range from MOR8 to MOR18. Laranian Followers with MOR7 reduce maximum Piety by 1; those with MOR5 reduce maximum Piety by 3.

## priest occupation

Characters must have the Ritual skill on their chosen Occupation's table to be clergy members in one selected religion. They determine Blessing Bonus, Piety, and Doctrinal Rolls just like other Followers. Consider these other circumstances that might affect how clergy function as PCs, with particular reference to the West Venarian pantheon.

High Circle : clergy of  Circle IV and above are usually limited in their actions beyond the duties of the office they hold-this often includes a near-literal restriction to a temple edifice. The religions of Ilvir and Siem are exceptions, as even high-Circle priests remain independent, even itinerant, by definition.

Low Circle : acolyte clergy are usually as limited in actions as are high-Circle clergy, often similarly restricted to a temple's location.

Mid Circle : clergy of  Circles II and III usually have the greatest breadth of action outside the social and physical confines of a church. Many religions include mendicants -Agrik Circle III, Ilvir Circle III, Morgath Circle II, Peoni Circle III-and these provide the greatest opportunity for independent action.

Temple Priests of some religions manifest a similar freedom-Sarajin (including skalds); Naveh Circle III-but most Circle III offices belong to a somewhat restrictive hierarchy, beholden to direct orders and ordained missions for actions beyond the church confines. This holds even more so for members of fighting orders, of all ranks and offices.

Cult of the Covenant : this pantheon is unique in that all Emhle laity may advance to Circle II without being considered clergy. However, worship is very informal, and offices are rare.

## church status example one

A character with Peoni Ritual ML12 and Morality 14 is a member of the laity and begins with maximum Piety 1 (no Circle plus one). The player applies the resulting +2 Blessing Bonus to the tests of one Doctrine Subject-Physical Recovery Rolls is selected from among three possible subjects (see Doctrine, page 335). This bonus modifies various recovery rolls to physical injury and ailments.

## church status example two

A character with Halea Ritual ML65 and Morality 12 has the Priest occupation and is a member of the clergy. She is Circle III and begins with maximum Piety 4 (Circle III plus one). The resulting +7 Blessing Bonus (Ritual Index 6 + 1) is applied to the tests of four Doctrinal skills, selected from among both the Low and High Ceremonies (see Doctrine, page 325). She chooses Charm, Musician, Intrigue, and Physician.

## combat data

As	the	last	step	of	character	generation,	record	these	eight	pieces	of	Combat	Data	and,	optionally,	notes	on	the	back	of	the	character	sheets.

## 1 combat skills

<!-- image -->

Record	Initiative,	Awareness,	Dodge,	and	Shock	ML. Evasion	is	Effective	Dodge	Index	×5	(page	79).

## 2 weapons

<!-- image -->

Enter	data	for	melee	weapons	(pages	97-106)	and missile	weapons	(pages	107-110).

## 3 armour &amp; clothing

<!-- image -->

List	the	character's	armour	suit	(page	112);	or	the individual	armour	articles	(page	117).	Note	the	suit or	articles'	unmodified	Encumbrance	(ENC).

## 4 armour values

<!-- image -->

Record in all locations the totalled armour values ( av )	from	all	articles	worn	(page	111).	Each	of	the four aspects ( b · e · p · f ) has its own av .

<!-- image -->

## healing base

The	ability	to	recuperate	from	physical	trauma, Healing Base (HB) equals the average of Endurance and Will-round up if END is greater than WIL (page	177).

<!-- image -->

## encumbrance

A	character's	final	Encumbrance	(ENC)	equals	the unmodified	ENC	of	the	armour	(see	number	3); plus	ENC	from	gear	(page	122),	adjusted	by	the modifier	derived	from	Strength	(page	112).

<!-- image -->

## move

Human-sized	folk	(including	Ælrhin,	Nadai,	and Malakta)	have	a	base	Move 50;	Kuzhai	have	a	base Move 30.	Add	to	this	a	modifier	derived	from	the average	of	Agility	and	Strength-round	up	if	AGL	is greater than STR:

| avg   |   modifier | avg   |   modifier |
|-------|------------|-------|------------|
| 4-5   |        -15 | 14-15 |        +10 |
| 6-7   |        -10 | 16-17 |        +15 |
| 8-9   |         -5 | 18-19 |        +20 |
| 10-11 |          0 | 20-21 |        +25 |
| 12-13 |         +5 | 22-23 |        +30 |

Encumbrance,	Fatigue,	and	Impairment	reduce Move.	This	effective	Move	is	how	many	feet	the character	covers	with	the	Move	action.	Some actions	allow	for	half	or	double	Move	(page	160). See	further	Move	Calculation	Option	(right).

<!-- image -->

## personal fatigue

How much fatigue a character accrues over a given period	of	exertion	is	called	Personal	Fatigue	(PF).	It equals effective ENC + 5.	END	SR	equals	Endurance Index	(one-tenth	of	END	ML,	rounded	down).

<!-- image -->

## possessions &amp; notes

Use these areas to record miscellaneous information,	such	as	other	possessions	and	gear, mount	characteristics,	known	spells	and	other esoterica,	or	background	details.

## move calculation option

Appendix III presents the option to generate the specific height and weight of characters (page	427).	The	results	are	divided	into	ranges,	providing	descriptive	traits	that	would more	likely	be	used	in-world,	such	as short or tall height; or light or heavy frame.

As an alternate approach to calculating Move that accounts for such build traits,	add to	a	base	50	for	any	Folk	the	two	modifiers	derived	below	from	the	character's height and frame traits.	Then	further	modify	for	Agility	and	Strength,	as	usual	(step	7,	left).

| height trait   |   mod | frametrait   |   mod |
|----------------|-------|--------------|-------|
| Small          |   -10 | Scant        |   +10 |
| Short          |    -5 | Light        |    +5 |
| Average        |     0 | Medium       |     0 |
| Tall           |    +5 | Heavy        |    -5 |
| Great          |   +10 | Massive      |   -10 |

A	Kuzhai	with	AGL 9	and	STR 15 generates	a	small	height	(-10 penalty) and a massive frame (-10	penalty).	This	results	in a	base	Move	30	(50 - 10 - 10). Accounting	for	AGL	and	STR	(+5 bonus) raises Move to 35.
