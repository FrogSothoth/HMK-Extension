# Arcane Talents

## Arcane Talents

Some entities possess innate magic powers called arcane talents. While similar to spellcasters in their ability to channel magic forces, talentusers have inherited their conduit rather than created it through study. Moreover, a talent's expression, once developed with practice, comes more easily-its magic requires no convocational attunement, cant or gesture; and is slightly less taxing. Pvarists believe some arcane talents function as a ready-made Form, with the user naturally able to summon Principle to create the effect. While their source is not fully understood, talents are detected and dispelled similarly to spells.

## Talent Invocation Routine

Calling forth an Arcane talent is called invocation. While all have an Aura · Will Skill Base, each talent is a skill with its own Mastery Level, referred to below as Talent ML. Some entities with just middling Auras could, remarkably, still have weak talent-use, perhaps the inherited vestige of a once-strong, but now waning, arcane legacy.

Follow these four steps to invoke an arcane talent:

[�] Talentstart : with the Incant action, the character selects the talent and begins invocation. The user must maintain concentration (page 182) throughout the invocation Time until the Invocation Roll is made.

Invocation Options : an invoker may abort or cancel an invocation just like a spellcaster (page 200, step 1.2). All references there to 'spells' and 'casting' instead apply to talents and invocation.

[�] Invocation Modifiers : Invocation tests Talent ML. Apply the following modifiers:

Loud Noise : invokers distracted by nearby noise, such as shouting or melee, suffer -10 penalty.

Trauma : fatigue penalty always modifies the test. Impairment that usually affects spell Casting Rolls (page 201) does not penalise it-only Grievous skull injuries prevent invocation altogether.

Place : arcane energies infusing a place might give an invocation bonus, like with spellcasting (page 201 sidebar). If so, it will be clearly stated.

Cant : invocation is inherently silent and still-there are no cant or gesture modifiers to talent-use.

[�] Invocation Roll : at the end of invocation Time, the character takes a 1-turn Incant action to make the Invocation Roll-a test of Talent EML on the table in the sidebar. The sequencing within a combat round follows the same procedure as that for spellcasting (page 202 sidebar).

Critical Failure : a CF means the invocation fails and results in fatigue accrual and Talent Misfire (page 260).

Critical Success : a CS means the invocation succeeds with no fatigue loss. Accompanying durations are tripled, unless otherwise noted. The talent description may include additional special effects from a CS.

[�] Fatigue : the success level of the Invocation Roll determines the amount of windedness fatigue accrued. Given the inherent nature of talents, characters become slightly less winded from critically failed invoking than from similarly failed spellcasting. However, the Aural Shock from misfire also inflicts weakness fatigue (page 190).

## talent dormancy

Arcane talents lie dormant throughout much of a character's childhood, only manifesting as brief psychic episodes that reflect their general nature: Sensitivity emerges as chills and shivers; Medium-sight comes as vivid nightmares. Each such episode might unconsciously increase the character's Mastery Level, until, upon exceeding ML19, the character finally becomes fully aware of the talent and consciously able to invoke it.

As noted in Chapter 2: Character , this period of dormancy will have likely already ended by the start of the campaign. However, depending on Age Group and the random roll determining the talent, a character might have a starting ML less than 20. In such a case, the player roleplays its slow revelation over the course of the campaign. Tests of a dormant talent, whether successful or not, represent sudden or random episodes that may lead to skill development and the character's eventual control of it once ML20 is reached.

## invocation roll

Make the Talent test on the following table. If successful, consult the talent's specific entry for its effect. Also see the Talent Format section on the following page for more details.

|     | talent test                                                                                                                        |   fatigue |

Invocation Example : Elben has Aura Elemental Bolt ML75. He stands knee-deep in a ford, facing strangely dark, turbulent waters which he suspects to be a Sheor, a water elemental. As noted in its entry (page 261), Aura bolt requires only a free action of invocation Time, so Elben makes the Invocation Roll on this very same turn (free action Time talentstart followed immediately by 1-turn Incant action to invoke). Distracted by a -10 penalty from the terrified shouts of his friends, the roll is 67 (EML65,) a Failure that inflicts Elben with 5 fatigue. He will try again next turn…

## talent misfire

A CF 0 Invocation Roll requires an immediate d100 roll on the Talent Misfire Table.

Crucial Talent Misfire : a Talent Misfire Roll ending in a 5 or 0 is a Crucial Misfire. In addition to suffering the effect of the Talent Misfire roll, the invoker endures the talent's idiosyncratic Crucial Misfire effect listed in its entry.

A character with one of these talents may make a special Invocation Roll (1-round invocation Time) at a target within Talent Index × 5 feet and LOS. A success reveals the target's True Form to the invoker. Effects that conceal a target's True Form (page 209 sidebar) prevent True Sight.

The Visnomy talent already reveals True Form as part of its regular use, but with half the range. Its invokers may also make the above True Sight test.

## amplification

Once per round on any IR, conscious invokers can increase one time the Index of a spell or talent by 2 (CS 3). They can amplify their own incantations; that of another incanter whom they touch at spell- or talentfire; or any known spell or talent already in effect within range.

## clairvoyance

True Sight

The invoker shifts perspective to a remote point in the physical world. One of two versions must be declared at talentstart:

Location (1 round): the invoker shifts the point of visual perception up to TI × 50 feet away (LOS not required). At the new point, the invoker may look around in any direction. A CS includes hearing and smelling perceptions.

Being (10 minutes): the invoker targets a being whose True Form the invoker has already perceived. A success gives the invoker a hazy TI × 5 -foot diameter vision around the target. At the start of each turn, make a d10 roll against a TN equal to Clairvoyance TI (CS +2). Success allows the mage to see clearly that round.

## disembodiment

With success invokers inhabit their active soul in the spirit world (page 293), leaving their body prone and inert (CS duration is not tripled, but all Spirit Action tests receive +10 bonus). A Reembodiment Roll is made after duration (page 298).

## elemental bolt

The invoker projects a mundane amount of one of the six elemental principles. The specific element corresponds to the character's highest Sunsign modifier. If two have the same modifier, then determine the element randomly between the two. The user may then only ever manifest this one kind of bolt.

Upon a successful invocation, the bolt automatically strikes its target (no defence). For bolts that strike a location, the caster freely chooses the zone but rolls d10 to determine the precise location.

Earth : a 3-inch diameter stone strikes a single target within range. The target suffers d4 + TI Blunt impact to one location (CS +5 impact).

Metal : a narrow 3-inch bolt of iron shoots out and strikes a single target within range. The target suffers d4 + TI Point impact to one location (CS +5 impact).

Fire : a narrow 1-foot bolt of fire streaks out to range and strikes a single target, who suffers d4 + TI Fire impact to one location (CS +5 impact).

Air : a 5-foot wide gust of wind bursts out to range in a chosen direction. Each creature in its path makes a Press Roll to resist the air burst, which has a STR equal to TI × 3. Roll once and oppose it by each target's own Press Roll (page 106).

Aura : one target within range makes an opposed test of Spirit against the invocation's success level (break ties). For each step-loss star, a being or astral suffers Aural Shock 1 (an astral must also make a Reembodiment Roll) or a spirit suffers d6 days of dissolution. In order to affect astrals and incorporeal spirits, the invoker must be able to perceive the spirit world-see the explanation given in the Aural Blast spell (page 238).

Cold : a narrow 1-foot-long bolt of ice strikes a single target within range. The target suffers d4 + TI frost impact to one location (CS +5 impact).

Throughout the rules, these various Talents are identified by their type followed by the word 'bolt'-Fire Bolt, Air Bolt, and so forth.

## enthral

True Sight

The invoker tests Enthral against a target within LOS and range. If successful, the target may resist with a Spirit test (break ties). Each victory step for Enthral leaves the target Stunned for one round, counted from the end of the invoker's turn. For duration, the invoker also raises by one Success Level any persuasion test the invoker makes against the target, who suffers all the usual effects of being Stunned (page 169) except for receiving a Shock Roll to overcome it. At the end of duration, the Stunned state is removed from the target, although any more serious state suffered during Enthral is recovered from normally. For example, an Enthralled target who becomes Stunned from a different source is now Incapacitated, a state which is not helped simply by the end of Enthral.

## extratemporality

With a successful invocation, the invoker briefly steps out of time, momentarily 'freezing' the surrounding environment. The mage immediately receives a second action on the same IR as the invocation. Everyone must Ignore the invoker's action. With CS, the invoker receives +1 success level to Awareness tests for TI rounds, even after the time-stop ceases.

## healing

With each test of Healing, invokers either target themselves or a touched creature and then select one of four actions at talentstart:

Diagnose : the invoker understands all a creature's physical trauma and receives +20 (CS +30) bonus to all subsequent Treatment Rolls of them.

Heal : one designated physical trauma receives +20 bonus to all of its Healing, Course, or Advance Rolls (CS +30). The invocation affects the same trauma only once but applies whether cast before or after mundane treatment. Only the highest similar bonus applies among several arcane sources (see Arcane Recovery, page 213 and its sidebar).

Invigorate : a success removes TI × 5 fatigue-apply first to windedness and then, with any remaining points, to weariness (there is no effect on weakness fatigue). This excludes the fatigue accrued from the invocation if mages cast it on themselves. A CS also grants +2 bonus to END SR associated with fatigue accrual and recovery for the next TI days.

Stem : a success immediately stops bleeding in one injury-no Blood Loss Rolls required (CS two injuries).

crucial misfire : Invoker accrues 20 weariness fatigue.

## hex

True Sight

The invoker gives the 'evil eye' to a single person. The invoker declares one of two versions of Hex at talentstart.

Close (Free action): target a person within half TI × 5 feet and LOS.

Far (10 minutes): target a person within Index leagues whose True Form the invoker has perceived.

The target resists the Hex with a higher Spirit test success level (break ties). If Hex succeeds, the target must include with every test throughout duration a d10 roll against a TN equal to Hex Index (CS +2). A d10 success reduces the accompanying test's success level by one-the curse of bad luck. If the invoker has a part of the victim ( a lock of hair ), increase the TN by 1.

crucial misfire : WIL Recovery Rolls from the Aural Shock have -20 penalty.

Range:

Duration:

1 hour (CS 1 day)

## medium

Passive Triggering

The GM makes a passive d10 roll against Medium Index when a medium in the physical world simply comes within TI × 5 feet of an active soul in the spirit world (one attempt per day per entity). The roll has -1 penalty for each point of Aura below 13 the active soul has. A d10 success gives the medium a vague notion of the nearby spirit presence. No fatigue is accrued, and failure has no effect.

Invokers may also actively make a Medium test after a 10-minute 'seance'. A success switches their perspective to the spirit world while still inhabiting their physical world body. Mediums may then take the Spirit Sensing, Communing, and Conflict actions in the immediate astral locale (page 293) . Throughout the invocation's duration, they may also converse haltingly with those in the physical world near them, and may even test Awareness with -40 penalty.

## natural attunement

Characters with Natural Attunement have an innate affinity with the elemental principle that corresponds to their highest Sunsign modifier (page 22). If two Sunsigns have the same modifier, then determine which one randomly. For example, a character with the Skorus Sunsign would have Natural Attunement with either Water or Aura.

Natural Attunement is not 'invoked' but instead imparts these six benefits:

[�] The character has automatic Primary attunement with the element's corresponding Pvaric convocation. Calculate a Pvarism SM as if it were a Talent according to the Talent Possession table (page 40), modified by Age Group (page 47). The character may then develop the SM further during character generation, as usual.

Example : a young character with AUR16, who rolls a 17 on the table, would have a base Pvarism SM2 (the 0 dormancy modifier plus the default young SM2). Spending one Optional DP would raise it to Pvarism SM3.

[�] The character may undertake Unassisted research in the attuned convocation with a minimum Pvarism ML10. This implies the possibility of being self-taught, and explains the presence of spellcasters outside the Shek-Pvar, such as hedge witches and warlocks or tribal sorcerers and seers.

[�] Starting at Pvarism ML40, Naturally Attuned mages may undertake Assisted research in the Neutral convocation (page 205). Assistance must take a substantial form, such as texts, scrolls, or another mage capable of casting Neutral spells.

[�] During character generation, the cost of Arcane Research Points in the Primary attuned convocation are halved (do not round). For instance, a Difficulty 1 spell costs only 0.5 ARP.

[�] During the game, all Research Times in the Primary attuned convocation are halved (a half day of research lasts five hours).

[�] Upon touching an artefact with the object element of the naturally attuned element, the character instantly achieves bonded attunement (page 208).

Upon a successful Metamorphosis Roll (page 210), a Grey Mage with Natural Attunement loses the talent, and all of the above effects no longer apply.

## negation

A spherical field with a five-foot radius extends around the invoker. Instantaneous or Temporary spell, enchantment, or invocation effects that target, pass through, or already exist in the area (including the invoker's) immediately terminate. An affected CS effect ends as well, but it also eliminates the spherical field. Otherwise, Negation lasts TI rounds, or TI minutes if the invoker maintains concentration.

## prescience

True Sight

The invoker gains an intuitive glimpse of the future in three different ways.

Danger Sense : Awareness tests made to perceive physical danger within TI × 10 feet always include a Prescience SR , a success of which increases the Awareness test by one success level. The character accrues no fatigue. Conceptual threats, such as an assassination plot, do not invoke the talent, but the imminent bodily attack associated with it would.

Fate Attunement : the character's Fate Roll ML is increased by an amount equal to the highest Index of Astrology, Runecraft, Tarotry, or Prescience.

Vision : once per 30 days the invoker may make a Prescience Success Value test. Each resulting star equals a same number of d10 Fate Increase rolls (page 276), but a CF causes Talent Misfire and results in no stars. Invokers distribute each of these one to five d10 rolls to either themselves or to anyone they designate whose True Form they have already perceived. The d10 rolls are made at once, even for those who have 5 or more FP. Both invoker and recipients must follow the rules as given under Querent Limitations (page 280).

## psychometry

True Sight

The invoker touches an object weighing up to TI ×  5 lbs and declares one of two uses of Psychometry at talentstart.

Question : a successful invocation grants the answer to a single yes-no question about the object. A CS allows the invoker to ask one qualitative follow-up question. A character's invocation may succeed on the same object only once until Psychometry ML increases.

Being : the invoker designates a person who has been in physical contact with the object and whose True From the invoker has perceived. A success reveals the distance and direction to the being's location in the physical world. A CS includes a brief general description of the location  in a forest glade or on a sailing shipbut not a literal view.

crucial misfire : Invoker must improve ML by 5 for next use of talent on the object.

Time:

10 minutes

Range:

Touch

Duration:

Instantaneous

## sensitivity

Passive Triggering

The invoker can sense arcane energy within TI × 5 feet. The GM makes a passive d10 roll against Sensitivity Inde x when the invoker comes within range of a source. A success yields a vague sense of arcane energy nearby but nothing about the exact source. No fatigue is accrued; failure has no effect. See the Detect spell (page 251) for more on arcane energy.

If the character succeeds on a 1-round active invocation, the category of all sources within range is revealedactive spell or arcane talent; artefact enchantment; elixir; raw principle; or rune object. A CS reveals more details, such as a spell's Complexity Level or whether an artefact is minor or major.

The character can also test Sensitivity as a 1-round invocation to establish artefact attunement (page 208).

crucial misfire : WIL Recovery Rolls from the Aural Shock have -20 penalty.

Time:

Free action or 1 round

Range:

TI ×  5 feet

Duration:

Instantaneous

## spirit

All living entities-folk, beasts, plants, natural spirits, elementals, even naturalpersonality artefacts-possess Spirit ML. It measures their strength of soul.

Spirit Shock Roll : what Shock ML is to resisting physical trauma, Spirit ML is to resisting some mental trauma.

Spirit Conflict : opposed Spirit tests measure the outcome of Spirit Conflict between two souls.

Spirit Attunement : entities test Spirit to establish proximate attunement and to invoke major artefact enchantments.

Spell Resistance : targets test Spirit to resist certain spells and enchantments.

Beings in the physical world with a dormant soul do suffer fatigue penalty in Spirit Conflict, but testing Spirit usually does not accrue fatigue itself, and a Spirit CF does not result in talent misfire. If an entity suffers Aural Shock or Dissolution, then a called-for Spirit test is always a CF.

## telekinesis

The invoker makes an object within range, and weighing no more than TI pounds, move up TI × 10 feet in any direction, all while in LOS. An attached portion may not be detached: all portions must be able to move as a unit. A creature holding the object can retain it by making a d6 + STR roll that exceeds the invoker's TI × 3. One of two versions is declared at talentstart.

Float : the object moves up to TI × 5 feet per round, slowly enough to be caught or land undamaged. By taking a one-round invocation time, the user may choose a zigzag path for the object.

Hurl : the object is 'thrown'. There is no attack roll, but the object's path must be direct from its origin to the target. A successful invocation means it strikes a Zone Number chosen by the invoker (roll a d10 Location Die). Impact characteristics are of a weapon most similar to the hurled object if not the actual one. A blunt object like a statue or rock inflicts d6 plus half its weight in pounds of b -aspect impact. A CS increases object impact by five.

crucial misfire : Object is hurled in a random direction out to maximum range.

## telepathy

True Sight

The invoker transmits a message in one of two ways (no shared language needed).

Close (Free action): the invoker targets a person within TI × 10 feet and in LOS.

Far (1 round): the invoker targets a person within TI leagues whose True Form the invoker has perceived.

The message is limited to a brief thought or feeling, such as Harken is at The Green Bough tavern ; or you are angry at the guard . The target must successfully test Spirit or Sensitivity with +20 bonus in order to comprehend the transmission (Telepathy CS: comprehension is automatic). The message and its reception all take place on the turn of the invoker.

The thought or emotion sent is not a compulsion. Comprehending targets simply react as if they naturally had the idea or felt the emotion themselves.

## transference

Passive Triggering

The GM makes a passive d10 roll against Transference Index when the invoker is within range of an anchored end of a fixed gateway, such as a Godstone or Barasi Point. A success produces a vague sense or hunch of a gateway nearby. No fatigue is accrued, and failure has no effect.

A character may actively invoke Transference to pinpoint the location of a fixed gateway within range. A CS also reveals its fixed destination. Use the table on page 155 to determine the terminus of a Godstone if it is currently set to one (it could be closed). For a fixed Barasi Point, generate the destination world below; the GM then determines the precise location on the given world:

| d100   | world         | d100   | world       |
|--------|---------------|--------|-------------|
| 01-19  | Blessed Realm | 41-65  | Sherém      |
| 20-24  | Kèthîra       | 66-75  | Terra       |
| 25     | Lósenor       | 76-99  | Yàsháin     |
| 26-40  | Midgaad       | 00     | Other world |

While touching a gateway, or standing in its known location, the invoker may test Transference to employ it. Up to TI beings touching the invoker's skin are also transferred. Anyone transferred may wear or carry objects weighing no more than half their own Spirit ML in pounds.

crucial misfire : WIL Recovery Rolls from the Aural Shock have -20 penalty.

## transmutation

The character has a soul-connection to a specific type of beast. Determine it randomly at character generation on this table (keyed to northwest Venarive):

| d100   | beast   | attribute 1   | attribute 2   |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| 01-05  | Bear    | Strength      | Will          |
| 06-10  | Boar    | Endurance     | Will          |
| 11-15  | Crow    | Perception    | Aura          |
| 16-20  | Eagle   | Eloquence     | Perception    |
| 21-35  | Fox     | Creativity    | Reasoning     |
| 36-60  | Lion    | Agility       | Will          |
| 61-65  | Stag    | Aura          | Agility       |
| 66-00  | Wolf    | Perception    | Will          |

Transmutation imparts three effects.

Beast Trait : the character in natural form has a permanent physical trait that reflects a subtle resemblance to the soulconnected beast. For example, a bearconnection could impart a hirsute body.

Attribute Boost : the character's two Attributes scores associated with the beast are raised to 16 (or increased by 1 if already generated as a 16 or higher). These changes are permanent, and are recorded during character generation before Skill Bases (SB) are calculated.

Shapechange : by successfully making an invocation test, characters may change shape into the soul-connected beast. They retain their own natural Personality (morality, purpose, grace, psyche, fate, mental attributes and skills based upon them, excluding Arcane skills save Spirit); but they acquire the beast's Physique (appearance, physical attributes and skills based upon them-the same as those listed for Possession on page 297. This includes the animal's senses and Scent).

Any trauma suffered in natural form is carried into beast form, and vice versa upon changing back (see below). The GM 'translates' injury locations logically ( a wing injury becomes an arm injury ).

The transmutation takes one minute (CS one round). Invocation fatigue is deferred until the shapechange duration ends, but the fatigue is then recovered as weariness instead of windedness (page 176). While in the process of changing, the character is Stunned (STN), ending once the transmutation occurs. Reverting back to the character's 'normal' form is instantaneous.

As a free action, the character may attempt to end the shape-change-either during the transformation or afterwards before the end of duration. This requires a successful Spirit test (retries allowed). If successful, Fatigue accrual still remains the same as for a full-length duration.

crucial misfire : Character is Incapacitated as long as Aural Shock lasts.

1 minute (1 round)

Self

Duration:

TI hours

## visnomy

True Sight

The invoker can sense a target's personality and True Form by simply viewing the subject's face. The character may invoke the talent even while engaged in idle conversation, although no literal communication is required as long as the invoker can observe the target's face within range. The following results of the Visnomy test are in addition to those listed in the Invocation Roll table:

## visnomy test
