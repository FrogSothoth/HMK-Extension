ADVENTURE 5

TRAUMA

## Mental Trauma

In addition to suffering physical trauma during adventures, characters might also face mental trauma such as fear, stress, and aural shock.

## fear

Simple fear is not uncommon; it arises and subsides rather quickly. Experiencing intimidation, suffering spell effects, or confronting a ghost can all force characters to make a Fear Roll. When required, they test Will on the Fear Roll table and apply the results immediately.

## fear roll

psy :	the	last	column	indicates	whether	the	character	accrues	Psyche	Stress Levels	and	how	many.	The	amount	is	0,	1	(CF5),	or	2	(CF0),	but	facing	entities	with Aberrance	increases	the	accrued	PSY	level	by	the	indicated	ABE	amounts.

## Aberrance

Some sources of fear are so bizarre, grotesque, or deviant that they make resisting fear more difficult and failing to do so more consequential. The source is usually a freakish beast or spirit (purely psychological), but could also be a fell artefact or spell.

Whatever the source, it expresses Aberrance (ABE), a score with no technical limit but usually between 1 and 6. Chapter 7: Bestiary notes which entities have Aberrance and how much.

## aberrance effect

The moment they perceive a source of Aberrance, characters and creatures make a Fear Roll. The GM determines when such 'perception' takes place and applies. Entities who possess Aberrance themselves are usually immune to its effect from other sources (see Advice &amp; Options on page 401 of Chapter 7: Bestiary for more discussion).

Fear Penalty : all accompanying Will tests have a penalty equal to the source's ABE ×5. This penalty also applies to the victim's Initiative tests.

Psyche Stress : Aberrance increases the Psyche Stress Levels accrued from the Will test on the Fear Roll table. On a failed test, the amount is increased by the ABE score (see sidebar example). Even on a Success (S), victims accrue PSY equal to half the ABE score, rounded down.

## types of fear

The Reaction and Morale Rolls of combat are types of fear mental trauma. However, the psychophysiology of confronting violent threat-especially that deriving from folkdiffers slightly from other sources of fear. Trained warriors respond more successfully in these situations, and so Reaction and Morale rolls test Initiative rather than Will .

## aberrance example

Galmos has been lured to a Nolah's cave by its Yearning Geas ability. He arrives confused (see page 374 example) but conscious enough to perceive the ghastly menace emerging from the shadows. Because the Nolah has Aberrance 1, Galmos immediately makes a Fear Roll with -5 penalty (ABE ×5). With a Will  9, Galmos tests EML40: a roll of 56 is Failure (F), leaving him afraid . He may Dodge or Block in defence, but must Pass or move away (retesting at the end of each turn). He also suffers one Psyche Stress level from the Nolah's Aberrance score, giving him a Psyche trait in about 10 minutes.

In the meantime, the Nolah acts first on IR60, swinging its morningstar. Not having a readied weapon, Galmos may only dodge. He survives and, on his turn on IR50, must Pass or move away-he flees from the cave at a full Move. At the end of this turn he tests both Initiative ML50, to overcome being confused (page 158), and Will ML45 to overcome being afraid . Each test must include -5 penalty from the Nolah's ABE1.

## stress accrual example

Faldrik is forced to make a Morale roll. A CF5 result renders him Routed but also inflicts 1 level of Psyche Stress. Faldrik runs away. About 10 minutes later, he becomes steady but acquires an indefinite psyche trait.

Faldrik previously had no psyche traits. A d10 roll produces Reckless . In the Stress section of the character sheet, the player writes Reckless PSY1 (Indefinite) .

Given Faldrik's Morality 8, the new trait is likely not the result of much guilt about leaving his compatriots behind. The player decides it comes from the trauma of nearly dying. Since it is only a trait, the player chooses when the recklessness manifests, imagining it occurs during future battles. With merely 1 PSY level, Faldrik has a good chance to recover from it quickly, before it becomes permanent (see Psyche Recovery section and the sidebar example on page 189).

## stress

Mental trauma that inflicts lingering damage is called stress. There are two types measured in the game: mundane Psyche Stress; and the more esoteric and fell Shadow Stress. Since the Shadow of Bukrai is closely associated with the entities called Morvrin, it is detailed in that section of Chapter 7: Bestiary (page 377).

## Psyche Stress

Psyche Stress is measured in Psyche Stress levels (PSY) , like physical trauma to the body is measured in Injury levels. Psyche Stress usually occurs as a derivative of other phenomena, such as critically failing a Fear or Aural Shock Recovery roll.

Each instance of stress produces its own PSY level, usually between 1 and 6. Players track each case of PSY separately, similarly to the recording of individual physical injuries. The Stress section on the back of the character sheet provides space for noting them.

## Psyche Trait

When psyche stress occurs, no matter the level, the character gains an indefinite psyche trait. Choose or randomly select one from the list in the sidebar; or create a unique one that better reflects the stress. The trait does not actually manifest until about 10 minutes after the trauma that caused it, but it then remains for as long as the character still possesses at least one of its PSY levels. During recovery, there is a chance the trait becomes permanent (page 189).

Fatigue : once the psyche trait actually manifests after the ten-minute delay, the character accrues 5 weakness fatigue per PSY level suffered. Such fatigue abates only with Psyche Stress Recovery.

## intensity

A new psyche trait is treated like any other personality trait-the player simply roleplays when the character expresses it during the game. Should the character acquire the same psyche trait again while still suffering from it, the intensity worsens to an Impulse . On the third time, the Impulse becomes a Disorder (the maximum intensity possible).

With increased intensity to Impulse or Disorder, the character must now make a Will test to keep the trait from expressing itself when challenged or triggered. Players can still voluntarily roleplay its expression as they wish without making a test, but they must make a test if they wish to suppress it when triggered. The success level needed varies according to the intensity-an Impulse requires a Will Success (S) to suppress; a Disorder requires a Will Critical Success (CS).

PSY levels : the PSY levels of multiple instances of the same trait add together. For instance, a character suffering from PSY1 stress with a Paranoid psyche trait faces a new stress that produces PSY2 stress. The GM and player agree that this new trauma also induces a Paranoid trait, thus combining both traits into a PSY3 stress with intensity increased to an Impulse. Alternatively, it could have been a new trait ( Hyperactive , for instance) with a separate PSY2 stress.

Duration : when a psyche trait expresses itself, it lasts for as long as the character faces the causal trigger and for about 10 minutes thereafter. For an Impulse or Disorder, a Will CF on the suppression test means it lasts for d6 × 10 minutes beyond facing the causal trigger.

## Psyche Stress Recovery

Characters make a Psyche Stress Recovery Roll for each instance of stress associated with the same trait. A recovery roll is a Will test once every d6 days on the Psyche Stress Recovery table (sidebar). Fatigue penalty does not apply.

Fatigue Recovery : each reduction of 1 PSY level removes 5 of the associated weakness fatigue.

## recovery summary

Characters continue Psyche Stress Recovery rolls for each separate instance until no PSY levels remain, regardless of intensity (Trait, Impulse, or Disorder) or duration (indefinite or permanent). This implies the following typical procedure:

- Psyche stress usually consists of a few PSY levels and a single indefinite psyche Trait . If the character avoids a CF on the Psyche Stress Recovery rolls, then the psyche trait disappears when PSY gets to 0.
- If the character rolls just one CF during recovery, then the psyche trait becomes permanent . The character continues making recovery rolls in order to reduce PSY and its accompanying fatigue to 0. However, the character will retain the psyche trait permanently.
- If the character rolls a second CF during recovery, then the permanent trait increases intensity to a permanent Impulse . A third CF would increase it to a permanent Disorder . The character still continues making recovery rolls until PSY levels are 0.
- Another way characters increase the intensity is to suffer new psyche stress levels for the same trait while recovering from the old stress associated with it. The intensity increases in the same manner: a Trait becomes an Impulse ; and an impulse, a Disorder . This is what happens to Faldrik in the sidebar Stress Recovery Example.

## psyche stress recovery

- cf grievous stress: an	indefinite	psyche trait	becomes	permanent.	A	permanent one	increases	Intensity	by	one	level.
- f no recovery: Psyche	Stress	remains; continue	recovery	rolls.
- s recovery: Psyche	Stress	reduced	by	1 ; character recovers when PSY is 0 or less.
- cs recovery: Psyche	Stress	reduced	by	2 ; character recovers when PSY is 0 or less.

## stress recovery example

When a critically failed Morale roll routed Faldrik from a battle today, he acquired 1 Psyche Stress Level and the Reckless trait. Faldrik now suffers 5 indefinite fatigue as long as the trait remains. The GM rolls a d6 to determine how much time passes before the first Psyche Stress Recovery roll: four days.

On the trail after sundown on the second of these four days, Faldrik's companions hastily set up camp in the dangerous, Gargun-infested foothills of the Rayesha Mountains. The player decides that during his watch Faldrik storms off into the perimeter forest, overly intent-reckless even-on rooting out any trouble before it befalls the camp.

Sure enough, he finds it. Four brigands, who had been stalking the group, ambush him alone. Faldrik manages to drive off two despite suffering a grievously disabled arm. The player wishes to fight on, but the GM calls for a Morale roll (page 162) under the circumstances. The player rolls a CF 0-Faldrik collapses, catatonic from fear, and acquires 2 PSY levels. Both GM and player agree these 2 PSY levels should combine with the PSY 1 of the Reckless trait, raising the total to PSY 3 (15 fatigue) and increasing its intensity from a Trait to an Impulse . Faldrik must now succeed on a Will test to resist his reckless urge when tempted.

The group rescue Faldrik and soon find a nearby manor village to rest. On day four, Faldrik makes his first Psyche Stress Recovery roll: a CS reduces the PSY to 1 (5 fatigue), with the Reckless trait remaining indefinite and still an impulse.

The GM rolls the second d6-day recovery period: five days. Faldrik eventually succeeds on the Will test, reducing PSY to 0, removing the fatigue and the Reckless impulse. After the nine-day odyssey of stress, Faldrik recovers unscathed.

However, note that if one of the recovery rolls had instead been a CF, the indefinite impulse would have become permanent . He would have continued making Will tests every d6 days until the PSY and fatigue were removed-but a permanent Reckless Impulse would have remained.

## aural shock recovery

- cf no recovery: Aural	Shock	remains; character	also	gains	1	Psyche	Stress level. Continue	recovery	rolls.
- f no recovery: Aural	Shock	remains; continue	recovery	rolls.
- s recovery: Aural	Shock	levels	reduced	by	1 ; character	recovers	when	they	are	0.
- cs recovery: Aural	Shock	levels	reduced	by	2 ; character	recovers	when	they	are	0	or	less.

Aural Shock Recovery Example : Khordara suffers Aural Shock 2 casting a spell. She recovers from the spellcasting fatigue within a few hours but suffers 10 weakness fatigue from the Aural Shock. The following day, her Will ML70 is tested-a 75 (CF) does not reduce the Aural Shock and leaves her with one Psyche Stress level, increasing weakness fatigue to 15. On the next day, Will is tested-a 65 (CS) eliminates both Aural Shock levels and allows her to cast spells again. She now begins Psyche Stress recovery in d6 days, suffering 5 weakness meanwhile.

## possession recovery

- cf no recovery: Possession remains; character	also	gains	2	Psyche	Stress levels. Continue	recovery	rolls.
- f no recovery: Possession remains; character	also	gains	1	Psyche	Stress level. Continue	recovery	rolls.
- s awakened: Possessed character renews Spirit	Conflict	with	the	possessing	entity.
- cs awakened: as	Success	(above),	but Possessed character receives a +20 bonus in	the	Spirit	Conflict	tests.

Possession Recovery Example : a lesser Gekrish Gytevsha defeats Nolora in Spirit Conflict-leaving her with Aural Shock 1-and then possesses her. The demon's personality mutes hers and controls her bodily actions. It takes Nolora two days to recover from Aural Shock; and then d6 (3) days later her Will ML80 is tested-a 47 (S) allows her to renew Spirit Conflict with the demon to end the possession…

## the shadow

The most dangerous mental trauma characters can face is the Shadow of Bukrai, the ethereal force that emanates from the servants and artefacts of Morgath. Whereas other trauma assails Will or Initiative, the Shadow tests Spirit in a struggle for the character's soul.

Rules governing the Shadow are organised in the Morvrin entry (page 377) of Chapter 7: Bestiary -how the phenomenon arises, the risks involved in facing it, how to recover from it, and the awful consequences of failing.

## aural shock

Characters sometimes suffer a temporary disruption between their soul and body called Aural Shock. Each instance of Aural Shock is rated from one to six levels (1-6); multiple sources combine into a single total.

While afflicted, characters may not make Aura and Aura-modified tests, such as Fate Rolls, Spirit tests, or tests of any skill in the Esoterica group. If forced to make one-such as when targeted by a spell or from artefact Contact Loss-then victims automatically achieve a CF.

To recover, characters test Will once per day on the Aural Shock Recovery table (sidebar). Fatigue and impairment penalties do not modify the test.

Fatigue : each Aural Shock level immediately produces 5 weakness fatigue. They abate only with each level reduced through recovery.

## Soul Dissolution

Beings , who have both a soul and a body, also suffer soul dissolution from Aural Shock. If dissolved while in the spirit world as an astral, a being immediately reembodies with an automatic CF on the Reembodiment Roll table (page 298); accrues Aural Shock; and suffers soul dissolution until recovered from the Aural Shock.

Spirits have only a soul in the spirit world, with no natural body in the physical world. Any time they would otherwise suffer Aural Shock, spirits instead simply undergo soul dissolution for one day per Aural Shock level. While dissolved, a spirit is unable to take actions, and any incarnation taken in the physical world is destroyed.

As a side effect, soul dissolution conceals an entity's True Form (page 209) from detection in both the physical and spirit worlds.

## Attunements

While suffering Aural Shock or dissolution, characters may not establish new attunements and are unable to exploit those that had already been established. For instance, mages who suffer Aural Shock may not cast spells, but they remain attuned to their convocation (just unable to access it). Characters attuned to an arcane artefact may not invoke it while suffering Aural Shock, but the character remains attuned to the artefact (just unable to use it).

## Possession Recovery

When a possessed being recovers from the Aural Shock and soul dissolution of the causal Spirit Conflict, the being's personality still remains mute (page 297). When mute, it inhabits its body and has perception in the physical world but is still possessed, unable to control its body or speak. The possessed being makes a Will test every d6 days on the Possession Recovery table (sidebar).

Once Awakened, the ultimate status of the character depends upon the result of the ensuing Spirit Conflict with the possessing entity:

Victorious characters are no longer possessed and regain control of their body. The possessing entity is dissolved.

Defeated characters have their souls dissolved and suffer Aural Shock. The possession begins anew.
