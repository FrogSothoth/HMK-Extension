# Divine Mysteries

## divine mysteries

As detailed earlier, the arcane mysteries interact most dramatically with the features of reality, such as when incanters channel energies from the spirit world into the physical world as spells. The less accessible astral mysteries require their practitioners to inhabit the spirit world, where their souls beseech great entities and forces for enhanced ability. While the workings of the divine remain unfathomable-the third and truly obscured mysterythat powers seem to manifest beyond the instrument of folk gives most Kethirans a faith in gods.

## the gods

The faith in gods expressed by the myriad cultures across Kethira usually manifests as polytheistic beliefs in supranormal essences that transcend the known physical and spiritual worlds. While details and concepts can vary considerably, the following creation lore believed by West Venârian adherents is illustrative.

## First Gods

Out of the universal chaos before time and space emerged entities, principles of power, that waged war against each other. These First Gods-the Immutable Ones, original essences-nearly destroyed the cosmos during the Natal Wars. Before making peace, the First Gods had created new essences, the Lesser Gods, to serve them in the war.

## Lesser Gods

Even after their release from service following the peace between the First Gods, the Lesser Gods continued to fight. While unable to destroy reality, these essences could kill each other. Throughout the conflict, new creatures were created, including the elder folk and humans, nearly equal in power to the Lesser Gods at one time.

Eventually, after many had been destroyed, the remaining Lesser Gods agreed to the Ke'lha-Hy-Var-Hyvrak , the Concordat of the Illimitable Tome. These divine rules explained how the surviving deities would be allowed to compete with each other and to what extent they could intervene in the lives of mortals.

## the concordat

In order to retain the peace with each other, the Lesser Gods agreed to sixteen principles in the Illimitable Tome. While no single rule is preeminent, their collective upshot is that the purpose and power of the Lesser Gods must remain beyond mortal understanding. Any intervention by the gods in the affairs of folk will usually appear mundane, even indistinguishable from natural events (see page 348 for further discussion of Concordat principles).

## divine aspects

Unable to control or even communicate with these essences in any conventional or esoteric way, Kethirans have only an indirect notion of the Lesser Gods. Some learned theologians do not even view them as single entities but rather as collections of transcendent powers aligned around conceptual groups called divine aspects .

As the Divine Aspects table on the next page shows, each of these twelve aspects is associated with seven descriptorsnumber , role , element , domain , world , psyche , and mode . The components of a particular aspect can shift over time; some might be shared by or traded between different aspects. Most importantly, the aspects explain how earthly cultures can worship the very same divine constellation of power in subtly different ways.

While each of the aspects is identified by a specific morpheme, such as zem or hal , the various Kethiran societies view them as unique deities according to their own interpretations of the same aspects. For instance, while two cultures might worship a god manifesting the very same zer aspect, one may venerate more the element of Secrets, while the other, Knowledge. Furthermore, most people believe in the collective existence of several such deities within a single pantheon .

## Pantheons

Over a score major collections of gods are identified throughout the cultures of just Venarive and Lythia alone, not to mention those of Kamerand, Mernat, and the dozens of smaller groupings among the many tribal peoples. Thus, the West Venarian and Azeri pantheon dominate the major realms of Venarive; the Besha pantheon expresses the cosmology of the people of the Beshakan Desert; the Anzelorian pantheon outlines the deities worshipped on the great southern subcontinent.

## religions

Within each pantheon are several religions, each identified according to the deity worshipped, itself associated with a specific aspect. Thus, the West Venarian pantheon includes Agrik , the fiery god of war; the Besha pantheon has Aranik , the lord of desert, sun, and war; and the Anzelorian pantheon counts Kosheng , the god of earthquakes, fire, and destruction. All three of these culturally distinct deities share an association with the divine aspect agr . This aspect-relationship, however, usually does not imply identical nor even similar worship practices. Each religion often expresses idiosyncratic rituals distinct from those of a different pantheon even if they share a connection to the same aspect.

## divine power

Many fantasy role-playing games that include gods in their world's reality present them as knowable entitiessometimes even as overtly manifest. Far from enigmatic, these gods are dramatically active. Moreover, their followers' power often takes form as accessible magic, simply an alternate but equal technique to that of wizards.

In HârnMaster , the rules governing the divine mysteries reflect the obscure nature of the gods in the world of Kethira. The power accorded to religious characters is more subtle when compared to that of arcane and astral practitioners-an appropriate, even requisite, game design that properly reflects the setting's reality.

Characters can explore the divine mysteries in two ways: through the possession of Grace and the practice of Ritual. Divine grace is explained first (page 311), followed by an overview of Venarive's several pantheons (page 313). The ensuing Religions section explains how the Ritual skill is central to church hierarchies and practices (page 315), and includes a look at the ten religions of the West Venarian pantheon. The Religion section ends with a presentation of an important tribal pantheon, the Emelan Cult of the Covenant (page 343).

## Esoterica

Nothing prevents characters from developing both Ritual and esoteric skills such as Pvarism or Astrology-Siemists and tribal peoples do so quite routinely. Nevertheless, the majority of orthodox religions do not incorporate magic into their rituals because of an observable truth: the arcane mysteries neither demonstrate the existence of the gods nor verifiably result from the gods' association with them.

However, a few religions, indeed, incorporate esoterica into summoning rituals. In the West Venarian pantheon, this includes the churches of Agrik, Morgath, and Naveh. Most people consider this 'black magic' or 'demonry'-a central reason why many realms proscribe these three religions. The more accepted faiths view the summonedwhether the Shadow or demons-not as a theological threat but rather as dangerous phenomena in themselves. The closing Divine Mysteries section provides game rules for performing such ritual summonings (page 346).

Players familiar with previous editions might prefer to skip ahead and read the specifics of a familiar religion-Agrik (page 323) or Larani (page 329)-to have in mind when reading the following broader, initial sections.
