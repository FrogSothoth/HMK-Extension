# Folk

## Folk

A being is a living entity with a soul in the spirit world that is anchored to a natural body in the physical world. Beings consist mostly of plants, beasts, and people:

Plants have a natural body and Aura.

Beasts have a natural body and Aura, Will, and usually a few other mental attributes.

People have a natural body and all the mental attributes but also, most importantly, express Morality.

People are further distinguished between those with only a Morality and those with a Morality who are also capable of expressing purpose as individuals-these latter people are called folk .

## Folk of Venârivè

Over 99% of the folk in Venarive are human , with the most influential remainder consisting of Ælrhin (elven-folk) and Darzulim (dwarven-folk). The following section first discusses these three folk, and then covers two lesserknown groups: the Malakta and the Nadi .

## npc blocks

Since humans express a variety of cultures and have a wide range of appearance, their characteristics are given in a generic format called NPC Blocks (below). Simply add age, gender, and cultural details as needed to the given rural and urban paradigmatic occupations (pages 364-365). Chapter 8: Campaign offers more on NPCs (page 410).

## Other Folk

Several other highly reclusive folk are found in Venarivethese will be detailed in future publications.

Ándanùji : the 'giant' folk among the high Thonian peaks, whose tusked, hairy visage is often mistaken as bestial.

Centâurin : the chimaeric 'horse-folk' who live in isolated tribal lands of Altor, Quarphor, Reksyni, and Ivinia.

Nâblúgi : the diminutive folk who dwell in the wilderness valleys of Palithane and Trierzon, and in Umelria.

## Other Living Entities

Several entities are close to being considered folk, but all lack one or more distinguishing qualities.

Gârgún are people but not folk, because they only express a vague purpose as a group or species (some call it 'racial memory'). While they have Morality, Gargun seemingly have no individual purpose.

Ívashù sometimes appear folk-like. The Nolahrin, for example, express all mental attributes and can even gutturally speak human languages. However, they lack Morality and so are technically beasts.

V'hîr possess all the mental attributes, speak languages, and have a depraved Morality-potential traits of a folk. However, the form they take in the world is not a natural body-not inherent to them. V'hir are not even beings, but spirits temporarily incarnated in the world.

## ælrhin

5 ' 5 " (short) · 13� lbs (light)  medium

The Ælrhin are the various types of elvenfolk spread throughout Kethira.

Sinái : the elves of the Kingdom of Evael on the island of Hârn. Some who commit crimes are banished-these Sinai are called Môrsinai .

Sidhé : the one in twenty Sinai said to be 'purer', whose extraordinary Auras make them powerful mages. The Máelos are the Sidhe of southern Mernat.

Naêri : the dark skinned, diminutive Ælrhin who dwell in isolation among the treetops of central Anzeloria.

Hwæthârwyn : the snow elves who live throughout the evergreen forests and tundra of north-central Venarive.

Sílfalai : the cousins of the Sinai who wander eastern Lythia, often blending quietly into human societies.

Hâramochú : the sea elves of Harazai, now limited to a few islands in the northern Kamerand sea.

Although light of frame, Ælrhin can often pass for human when among those of similar complexion. Most Sinai and Sidhe are pale skinned, but the Naeri of Anzeloria are rich black.

Elven-folk do not die of old age, although they can be injured or killed by violence or accident. They usually grow weary of the world after a millennium and-mysteriously-depart for the Blessed Realm.

## origins

Legend has the god Siem leading the Ælrhin to Kethira about 10,000 years ago, several thousand years after the Earthmaster's departure. It is said they were fleeing strife on Midgaad, perhaps stopping 'briefly' on Kethira on their way to the Blessed Realm. Their greatest legacy to the world is the study of magic; most directly attribute the development of Pvarism to the Ælrhin.

## present

Elven-folk realms have gradually receded from direct human contact for centuries. The itinerant Silfalai of far eastern Lythia are an exception, as is the occasional emissary from Evael, which has a special relationship with the nearby human Kingdom of Emelrene. Coming of age at 144, young elves are the most likely Ælrhin to travel the world.

## reverie

All Ælrhin enter long periodic trances or contemplations known as Reverie (page 308). Doing so esoterically enhances their woodland skill and recuperative powers. However, failing to enter such states frequently damages their psyche and hastens their world-weariness.

## ænarin

Although rare, the offspring of elves and humans-Ænarin ('half-kin')-have much of the grace and sensitivity of the Ælrhin parent, with the physical stature of their human one. They blend into human society even more than elves, some actually remaining unaware of their lineage. Ænarin do not enter Reverie, and they grow to adulthood at the same rate as humans. However, while not immortal, half-elves often live beyond a century.

## dârzulim

4 '6" (small) · 117 lbs (heavy)  medium

The Kuzhai-which means 'true people'-are Kethira's principal Dârzulim (dwarven-folk), more well-known among humans than their deep-dwelling nemesis, the Chostori. Of near-mythic status, the Kuzhai number less than 60,000 throughout the entire world. While secretive and clannish, they are honourable traders and renowned crafters.

A Kuzha is quite short by human standards but has a stout build. The vast majority have a light, indeed, pale complexion, with brown or auburn hair and grey or blue eyes prominent. Most males wear forked beards; in other respects, the Kuzhai resemble humans.

## origins

Kuzhan legend says they tunnelled their way to the surface after awakening from a sleep deep underground. Human scholars believe they came to Kethira from elsewhere, perhaps by way of Godstone from the same world the Sinain had left.

At their emergence in the Mamardhez Mountains of central Lythia around bt 7200, the Kuzhai were of seven tribes: Dain, Tol, Er, Lar, Az, Zer, and Kon. Their city Merdain exerted great influence on human culture. In fact, the word Kethira is a Kuzhan word: kèth(mother); -îra (of all). They also invented the Khruni script, from which Runic descends. For unknown reasons, six of the tribes left Merdain to establish their own kingdoms elsewhere on Kethira.

## present

Even after seven thousand years, the kingdoms of Azadmere on Hârn and Kuzjera in Ivinia have remained in contact with each other; they are also the most widely known by human society. These Kuzhai are aware of both Erdar and Larhakul in western Katarh but have seemingly lost contact with them.

Only Kuzhan scholars know the exact location of Merdain , the first city, its status clouded by rumours of corruption. The realm of Kazerad in far-off Kamerand is nearly legend even in the minds of Kuzhai. It remains isolated within a land struggling against the cruelty of the Empire of Yerazhen.

Lastly, the location of Zhumertol , founded by the tribe of Tol, is lost even to the Kuzhan wise, whose memories shape it as a utopia of peace and plenty.

## malák

5 ' 11 " (tall) · 17� lbs   medium

The Malakta are one of the Yàsháinrhin (people of Yashain). Except for their human-looking face, a brown, hard chitin-plate covers their entire head and body. While soft-spoken and honourable, they are great swordmasters and wield their long retractable claws in lethal close combat. Malakta culture values questing, so they often leave their home world to become mercenaries elsewhere. One such colony of fighters is said to reside among the mountains of eastern Emelrene.

Chitin-plates : a penetrating strike to a location that exceeds twice the armour value of the chitin-plate reduces its AV by 1 in all aspects. Each location receives an ML65 test every five days to regenerate 1 point of lost AV (CS 2 AV).

Face Mask : in battle Malakta don a plate face mask which is often stylised to resemble their own chitin-plates.

Limb Block : because of their chitinplates, Malakta do not hesitate to employ Limb Blocks (page 106), especially against unarmed opponents.

## nâdi Mizúni

5 ' 4 " (short) · 137 lbs  medium

Mizuni in their own tongue, the Nadi are an isolated folk who dwell in the Nadami Mountains along the Shorkyne-Trierzi border. They are clever and creative, good crafters with slim, dexterous fingers. Nadi merchants descend from Mizuna, their underground citadel-city, to trade with nearby humans. A vaguely caninelike visage often startles outsiders, so they usually don hooded tunics and robes.

Fur : under their artful quality clothing, a natural coat of dense, well-groomed fur covers Nadi from head to foot. Both garments and hair range in colour from white to dark brown, with the more common lighter shades helping them blend into snowy mountain landscapes.

Herder : the character noted here is a Nadi herder, skilled in the seasonal movement of cattle and goats from lower winter valleys to higher summer pastures ( Animalcraft ML70 · Survival ML62 · Tracking ML55 ). Such herders often dwell through the warm months in stone cabins near their livestock, serving as observant guards for Mizuna.
