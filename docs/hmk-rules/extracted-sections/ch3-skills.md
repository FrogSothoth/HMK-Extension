few paces behind the cart, Alun walks at the edge of the track, not always careful to avoid a sudden slip into the wheel-cut ruts of the hardened mud. Kora could never tell if her brother was tired or bored or sad-probably sad. On foot herself, leading in front, she turns to click assurance to Ota, their draught horse, and tries to get a look at Alun's eyes. But he is looking down, frowning, as he trudges along with his cloak wrapped tightly around his arms.

The tall hedgerows on either side of the road mean they are nearing Lasomer, now passing through its peripheral fields. Before turning away from Alun, Kora spots, beyond the hedges, two farmers in the distant field abruptly abandoning their ox-driven plough. A third briefly stays behind, trying to unhitch it, but soon flees himself. They run in the same direction as she and Alun, at a closing angle, stumbling now and again as they dart over the earthen ridges in the field.

Kora looks down the track ahead. The smell of smoke reaches her before she sees it-a belching plume that rises above the treeline. To her left, a woman in the distinct green spring robes of a Peonian priestess suddenly appears through a gate in the hedge. With trembling hands raised to her face, she blurts out in a sobbing panic 'They're back!', then spins around and runs.

Kora stops Ota and goes to the back of the cart. She sets a stack of pots on the ground, hauls out a long blanketed bundle, and removes from it a war sword; her grip easily turns its heavy blade. Alun looks at her emptily, opens his cloak, and draws out a bowstring he keeps coiled up a sleeve.
