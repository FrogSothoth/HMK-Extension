he aperagris, master of the High Discipline, clutches with his left hand the chain around the waist of a wretched man who teeters at the edge of the octagonal pit. The grip prevents the captive from plunging into its blackened depths, but the gouts of infernal heat rushing up have blistered and scorched his face and bare chest. One arm hangs limply, broken and twisted backwards at the elbow, and blood streams from torturing cuts to his throat. The Aperagris raises a steel mace in his other hand and shouts in Surikal 'Release!', and so he doesand the chained man falls headlong into the pit, not conscious enough to scream.

From the circle of swaying priests around the edge of the chamber, a high priest-the Viriahn-now strides forward and begins a loud and discordant chant in the ancient tongue Zakimladal. He stops at the pit, and bellows a tearful and angry exhortation for many minutes. Sweat pours from beneath his lacquered helm, but the scales of ornate armour deflect the heat.

A wispy smoke appears in the pit and slowly rises in strange curls. It gradually collects into a thick mass, stretching to the room's stone ceiling in defiance of the scant breeze. Within its inky centre two small red spots materialise-two eyes, then clearly the fiery visage of a creature made of hardened magma. It appears suspended in the black smoke, with two scalloped wings slowly flapping, keeping it bizarrely afloat. After a final hoarse shout, the Viriahn collapses to hands and knees, and a second cloven-hoofed beast appears, awaiting command alongside the first.

## kèthîran features

Kethira is home to a variety of creatures, spirits, and strange forces. Detailed here are the most prominent types found in northwest Venarive:

These eight categories are organised alphabetically, each with an overview explaining characteristics common to the type. Specific entries within each category provide further unique game data and descriptions.

This and the following two pages also describe rules that can apply generally to many entities, such as Aberrance , Body Locations , Creature Size, Flying, and Scent .

## Aberrance

Some entities are so strange or horrific that they induce a Fear Roll when encountered. These entities are said to have Aberrance (ABE). Ivashu, Morvrin, and many Spirits have an ABE score, usually shown in their Attributes table. See page 187 for effects and page 401 for other options.

## Body Locations

The 10-zone Body Location table in the Injury Sequence (page 167) is keyed to a human-sized target. Many creatures have unique tables to reflect their own size and physiology. See the box, below.

Animal Tables : domesticated and wild animals have shorted Body Location tables, identified by a letter code in their respective entries. Animal Armour Values across the four aspects remain the same in all locations. For example, a palfrey horse has AV b 5 e 4 p 2 f 4 in all its locations, which are given in Table c (page 355).

Eyes : if using the Face Location option (page 133), no creature listed here has AV for its eyes.

## Creature Size

Creature body size can dramatically affect encounters. See Advice &amp; Options (page 401) for additional discussion.

Armour Value : a creature's AV reflects the material and mass of its body. Extremely tiny creatures likely have negative AV (see Negative Impact, below). Conversely, giant creatures have a higher AV than their hide might indicate, a reflection of greater mass.

Eluding : small creatures have fewer body zone numbers than larger ones. A warrior thrusting a d8 ZD spear at a Vlasta with only 3 ZN could succeed on the opposed Melee test but end up missing the small creature if the spear's Zone Die roll is not 3 or less. Such eluding could also happen when a Mature Dragon's d12 ZD claw strikes a smaller, human target that has only 10 ZN.

Mighty Strike : attackers with STR at least 10 points above a target's STR receive a free Press Roll when they roll a S or CS on their Melee test against a target who Blocks or Counterstrikes, even if the target wins the opposed roll. Such mighty strikes apply to all weapon types, except bites, grabs, and any the GM deems inappropriate (whips).

Negative Impact : small creatures likely have an Impact Die with a negative modifier. When generating strike impact, retain a negative impact result until the application of AV, since negative AV may very well turn the impact positive.

Example : the claw of a domestic cat does but d8 - 7 e impact. Against a warrior in even just clothing, this usually inflicts no injury. Against another cat with AV-4 versus the edge aspect, injury is more likely. For instance, a cat's d8 impact roll of 4 generates -3 strike impact; but the target cat's AV-4 increases this to effective impact 1 and thus an M1 injury (-3 + 4 = 1).

Overruns : at any given moment of their turn taking the Move or Charge action, creatures may ignore the Engagement Zones and occupied space of opponents whose sum total of body zone numbers (ZN) is less than theirs. For example, a horse (20 ZN) can ignore at any given moment the EZ and occupied space of one human (10 ZN), but not two or more. Larger creatures may 'overrun' the EZ/ space of these smaller creatures without their turn ending. They may even continue moving after the overrun, if any of their movement remains, and regardless of what happens to the opponents.

Reach : the effect of a creature's size is already included in its weapon reach, from the very small Vlasta (-2 reach) to the very large Old Dragon (+6 reach). The nature or shape of natural weapons can also modify reach-the long necks of dragons give them an extra +2 reach, for instance.

Strength Impact Modifier : the modifier from the table on page 97 has already been applied to all pertinent creature data. This includes adjusting a creature's Armour Value, reflecting body mass, as mentioned above.

## Flying

Creatures capable of flight have a dedicated flying Move ( fly) . The same movement rules of the Combat Routine apply to flyers, except where noted here.

Diving : flyers can attain a double Move in a dive. Striking a target after a dive increases impact (page 354 sidebar).

Slow flying : the slowest forward flying rate is a half Move, independent of circling routes and wind current effects.

Stumble Rolls : flying creatures that fail a Stumble Roll must reduce their Move rate at the start of their next turn (double to full; full to half). Failing a Stumble Roll at the half Move rate means they lose altitude equal to half Move.

Walking : a flyer has a grounded (walking) Move equal to one-tenth its flying Move (if not otherwise given).

Wing Injuries : Minor and Serious wing injuries affect all Impaired tests and Move. One Grievous wing injury forces flyers to ground (two means they fall).

## Scent

Many creatures have an acute ability to recognise scents, some in exotic ways (snakes analyse the chemicals of smells through an organ in their tongue). Such ability is measured by Scent Index , as given in the scent column of the animal tables or alongside the physical Attributes in a stat block ( snt) . Scent Index has two applications.

Tracking : the creature may stalk prey by making an Awareness Success Value test and adding Scent Index to the SV. The result is applied to the Tracking table on page 147. Each SV beyond 9 raises the Spoor stars by one.

Surprise : when testing Awareness in opposition to another's Stealth, the creature may add its Scent Index to the resulting victory steps when downwind of the other. The benefit is lost in Windforce 3 or 4 (gales and storms).

## Special Trauma Conditions

Some creature attacks inflict an Indefinite condition, like paralysis. After each given Healing Period (HP), the victim tests HB × HR on the Exposure Healing Roll table (page 185). When HR rises to 6, the condition is removed.

## Weapon Defence Options

In the entries throughout the chapter, the Defence Options allowed by a creature weapons are implied by how the corresponding Defence EML ( def ) are displayed:

| example   | def   | defenceoptionexplanation                  |
|-----------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| handaxe   | 60    | Block and Counterstrike, both EML60.      |
| punch     | 60|70 | Block* EML60|Counterstrike EML70.         |
| bite      | • |70 | Block not allowed | Counterstrike EML70.  |
