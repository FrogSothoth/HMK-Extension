Being : a being is a living entity whose soul in the spirit world is anchored to a body in the physical world.

feature Entity Energy The practitioners of the astral mysteries do not routinely manipulate the primal forces of Kelestia from the physical world. Instead, they manifest esoteric ability by journeying to the spirit world and petitioning for it. If successful, the astralist returns to the physical world, able now to express powers with an effect similar to arcane magic, just less dramatic and strange. An overview of Kelestia (reality) helps explain the processes involved in the astral mysteries. For further definition of terms, see the Keléstia Glossary (page 430).

## keléstia

As far as most Kethiran scholars have gathered, reality consists of two realms: the physical world and the spirit world. While the divine mysteries remain enigmatic with regard to this bifurcation, both the arcane and astral mysteries function as the result of interactions in these two worlds between various entities and energies.

## Entity

An entity has an immortal soul in the spirit world or a mortal shape in the physical world-or both. Entities are further distinguished as either living or non-living.

## living entity

A living entity possesses a soul in the spirit world. Also called its True Form, this soul, while immortal, can suffer temporary dissolution, a condition akin to unconsciousness in the physical world.

Spirit : a spirit is a living entity with only a soul-there is no shape to which it is naturally anchored.

Shade : a shade is created when the body of an astral traveller dies or when a being dies and the soul is left unclaimed. If the being suffered a great wrong at the time of death, the soul might remain hauntingly unrestedsuch a spirit is called a ghost .

Natural Spirit : a natural spirit lacks shape in its inherent state. However, some may assume form in the physical world, like the terrible Agrikan V'hir demons. Such an incarnation interacts with its surroundings in a way very similar to an actual body.

Elemental : the various intelligent elementals-such as the Beleras (fire elemental) or Sheor (water elemental)-are spirits capable of acting in the physical world by binding to their corresponding natural substance. They are likely even more primal than natural spirits.

Person : people are distinguished from beasts by their possession of a Morality attribute. A subset of people called folk are capable of possessing individual purpose. Folk include Humans, Ælrhin (elves), Darzulim (dwarves), Nadi, Malakta, and even the rarer Centaurin of the central Lythian plains.

Astral : an astral is a being who inhabits an active soul in the spirit world while the body remains inert in the physical world (disembodiment) or even disappears entirely (dematerialisation). Shamans actively take such journeys; dreamers might involuntarily do so, too.

Beast/Plant : all beasts and plants possess a soul in the spirit world, however faint in the latter's case.

Artefact (Will) : an object magically infused with the soul of a living creature becomes a still-living Will-artefact.

## non-living entity

A non-living entity-such as a sailing ship or corpsepossesses only a shape in the physical world. These objects , while having no soul, still make a vague impression in the spirit world. An object infused with the spell False Soul becomes a non-living Ego-artefact.

## Energy

Ethereal forces have neither a soul nor a shape but still make a very powerful impression in reality.

Principle : the energy that incanters like Pvarists attempt to harness, such as Earth, Fire, and Aura. Principle energy can exist in both the spirit and physical worlds; objects infused with it become magic artefacts.

Place : energy in the spirit world that is anchored to a location in the physical world. Ambient fields, ethereal rivers-their variety and bizarreness seem limitless.

Gateway : ethereal phenomena that often transport entities or their thoughts. Arcanists can employ these forces for various uses in and between the physical and spirit worlds.

## astral journey

Beings inhabit a body in the physical world anchored to a soul in the spirit world. Their perspective-sight, hearing, smell, touch-is limited to the landscape of the physical world and is tested with the Perception attribute and Awareness skill. Most folk and creatures exist this way their entire lives. Upon death the soul unanchors from the mortal body, and the being switches its physical world inhabitation and perspective to the spirit world.

## astrals

Beings who temporarily inhabit their soul in the spirit world while still living are called astrals. Their new perspective allows them to sense and move in the spirit world. Such an experience is called an astral journey.

## astralscape

Astrals often call what they perceive during an astral journey as the spirit world's astralscape. Their Empathy attribute helps determine how well they 'see'-or, more accurately, feel-their surroundings. The impression entities and forces make in the astralscape also depends upon their own essential nature. Some even reflect to varying degrees the shape they take in the physical world.

Spirits are their True Forms in the astralscape. While an astral would not associate this with something commonly seen in the physical world, in most cases there is some correspondence. For instance, the glimpse of a demon in the physical world-however chilling-imparts a much more vivid and terrifying impression in the astralscape.

People inhabiting their bodies in the physical world come across to an astral less as a distinctive shape than as a multicoloured cloud, the intensity of which reflects the strength of their mental attributes. The glow of those with especially high Auras might even take on a translucent version of their bodily, physical shape.

Astrals manifest to other astrals as multicoloured shapes according to their mental attributes, as for people. However, since inhabitation has switched to their soul, the colours appear more vibrant and animated compared to those of folk still in the physical world.

Creatures and Plants present a guise according to their Aura. Animals glow more brightly than plants and more often resemble their physical forms. Plants register only slightly and might be difficult to discern, except for special examples-the appearance of an ancient tree in the astralscape more likely echoes its physical form.

Objects such as buildings, tools, or furniture seem dark and translucent in the astralscape, shadowy masses only vaguely matching their physical world shape and size. Artefacts with Ego personality produce greater clarity of the objects they inhabit.

## other physical worlds

Kethira is the nexus of a collection of seven physical worlds that includes Terra, Sherem, Losenor, Midgaad, Yashain, and the Blessed Realm. Esoteric methods are used to travel between the worlds, though none are certain and completely safe. The physical worlds are also sometimes called corporeal planes, and scholars believe there are many others beyond just the seven.

## other spirit worlds

Entities and forces extrude from the physical world, with a geographical correspondence, into the spirit world-into what is often called the ethereal plane. This plane also extends as a connection between the various other physical worlds' own ethereal planes-thus, establishing a multitude of spirit worlds.

Principle Energy is quite discernible in the spirit world. Spell effects in the physical landscape glow in the astralscape in colours corresponding to their convocation and in shapes and sizes reflecting their power. A high Complexity Level spell leaves a dramatic impression, even if its energy manifests unseen in the physical world (such as with a powerful charm spell).

Pure forms of ethereal energy pass in volatile streams and imposing shapes. Sometimes an astral traveller might perceive a slight portion of such energies disappearing in a tornadic spiral-evidence of an earthly mage channelling it into the physical world as a spell.

Place Energy displays itself readily in the astralscape. Arcane chantries in the physical world appear as busy, flashing nodes of coloured light. Some lællyn of Emelrene seem like vast multihued oceans or fast-moving rivers. Like principle energy, place energy strikes an unaccustomed astral as peculiar but not entirely unfathomable.

Gateway Forces manifest dramatically. Barasi Points rise vertically into the infinite 'sky' of the astralscape, with one end sometimes writhing unanchored to any point. Godstones express almost identically their physicalworld shape and colour-but their grey hue here is brighter, nearly white. Scholars do not understand fully these strange edifices that some posit are actually living entities. The great mage Barasi al Kynvallwyn of Melderyn speculated that even Barasi Point filaments might be some form of spirit entity that comes into and out of existence through natural processes.

## astral journey routine

When a being wishes to make an astral journey, follow these four steps:

| [�] Lift the Veil ...............................................page ���   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [�] Inhabit the Soul.........................................page ���       |
| [�] Engage the Spirit World ..............................page ���          |
| [�] Lower the Veil............................................page ���      |

[�] Test : Lifting the Veil tests Trance (Disembodiment talent adds its Index to Trance ML). The character must be conscious at the start. All types of fatigue apply as a penalty to the test except any that might arise from the trance technique, such as dancing. Anything that breaks concentration (page 182) also prevents or ends the trance.

Fatigue : only beings who currently inhabit their body suffer fatigue. Astralists who have accrued fatigue before an astral journey apply its penalty only upon reembodiment in the physical world (page 298). Beings in the physical world with a dormant soul do suffer fatigue penalty to Spirit tests, since they inhabit their bodies. This most often occurs when resisting spell effects and during Spirit Conflict (page 296).

## [�] Lift the Veil

Astral journeys begin with would-be travellers inhabiting their body and having a perspective in the physical world. The first step is to gain access to the spirit world-to lift the veil that hides it from the physical world and allow the astralist to inhabit the soul. This may be done through one of six different methods .

## method one: trance skill

Shamans and mystics throughout Kethira have developed ecstatic techniques to lift the veil. Whether through dance, chant, or meditation-according to tradition-these methods are treated identically as the Trance skill and require the following five steps.

Concoctions : hallucinogenic potions (page 75) allow imbibers to lift the veil more quickly during a trance and also give them a bonus to the Transcendence Roll in step 4.

Astralists suffer no fatigue or impairment penalty to tests during the astral journey. Trauma inflicted upon their bodies in the physical world has its usual effect-the character makes Shock Rolls-and any shock state short of KIA forces the astral to reembody (page 198).

[�] Time : one hour. Although varying by culture, each trance method requires a lengthy, uninterrupted rite to shift perspective and inhabitation to the spirit world.

[�] Distraction : since some characters chant or dance to enter their trance, extraneous noises usually do not hinder the process. However, any disruption not part of the given technique-being awkwardly shaken, struck by a weapon, or affected by a spell-automatically ends the trance.

[�] Transcendence Roll : after the one hour time, test Trance on the Transcendence table.

## transcendence roll

## trance test

- cf no effect :	character	makes	a Will test; Failure (F) causes Aural	Shock 1 (CF 2) .

- cs veil lifted : astralist inhabits the soul and perspective shifts to	the	spirit	world.	Journey	duration	increases	by	d3	rounds.

[�] Result : if successful, the character's body becomes inert (a sort of benign coma), and perception and inhabitation switch to the spirit world. The astral journey has begunproceed to the second step, Inhabit The Soul (page 293).

## method two: disembodiment talent

The veil shrouding the spirit world can also be parted by an astralist possessing the Disembodiment talent-follow the steps for Invocation and refer to its specific entry (page 261). The same concoctions that enhance Trance tests usually do so here, as well. Disembodiment differs from Trance in two important ways.

Time : the 10 minutes to invoke the talent is considerably quicker than entering a trance.

Duration : the journey's maximum length in rounds equals Disembodiment Index. However, a CS Invocation Roll does not extend duration but rather offers the extra clarity of +10 bonus to all Spirit Actions in step 3 (page 294).

## method three: dreamwalk elixir

The most accessible method of transcending the veil is by imbibing a Dreamwalk elixir (page 271). It grants to any character the chance to lift the veil.

Time : the mere five seconds to imbibe an elixir makes this the fastest way to lift the veil.

Duration : the journey's maximum length in rounds equals the Alchemical Strength (AS) of the elixir-and thus derives from the skill of the concoction's maker and the Aura test of the imbiber (page 269).

## method four: lucid dreams

Whether or not all dreams a being has while asleep are astral journeys, some of them in fact are. Most scholars deem such Lucid Dreams as a weaker and passive version of the Disembodiment talent. However, they also believe them common to all living beings simply by virtue of their possessing a soul.

For beings inhabiting the physical world, each CS on an Aura test, a test of a skill with Aura in its Skill Base, or a Fate Roll, grants one Lucid Dream check during their next sleep. A CS on a similar test made by an astral in the spirit world does not grant such a check.

When called for, the Lucid Dream check is made by comparing a d20 roll with the being's Aura attribute score:

|       | auraattribute   | auraattribute   | auraattribute   | auraattribute   | auraattribute   | auraattribute   | auraattribute   | auraattribute   | auraattribute   | auraattribute   |

| 16    | •               | •               | •               | •               | 1               | 2               | 3               | 4               | 5               | 6               |

| 19    | •               | 1               | 2               | 3               | 4               | 5               | 6               | 7               | 8               | 9               |
| 20    | 1               | 2               | 3               | 4               | 5               | 6               | 7               | 8               | 9               | 10              |

A resulting number (1-10) signifies a Lucid Dream, during which the character's soul engages the spirit world (page 294). The Lucid Dream lasts a number of rounds equal to either the generated number from the table, or the dreamer's Will Index, whichever is lower. At its end, the dreamer then makes a Reembodiment Roll (page 298).

Multiple Checks : beings receive one Lucid Dream d20 check for each Aura-based CS achieved during the previous day. Make all the rolls separately, but apply only the single highest result (do not add their durations).

Sâvirìs : before the first round of the Lucid Dream, roll another d20. If less than or equal to the dream's total Spirit Round duration, then an Aura Elemental binds to the dreamer's Aura (see Dream Binding, page 362).

Lucid Nightmares : spirits such as Eldest Ones and Gytevsha can induce Lucid Nightmares. Here, the spirit attacks a soul in the astralscape during sleep. The victim experiences the ordeal as a horrific dream-such trauma occurs whether the sleeper achieves a Lucid Dream or not.

## method five: shèk-pvâr spells

Two Lyahvi spells provide a limited access to the spirit world. See steps 2-3 for an explanation of the terms.

Figure (Lyahvi VI) : with a spellfire Success (S), the caster lifts the veil for half SI rounds (CS +1 round).

Passage (Lyahvi V) : with spellfire Critical Success (CS), the semi-corporeal caster can make Spirit Sensing tests.

## method six: ælrhin reverie

During a daily Rest Reverie, elven-folk may optionally make one free Lucid Dream Roll, cumulative with any received from other sources. See the Ælrhin Reverie section (page 308) for more information.

a

Lucid Dream Example : Elben makes a Fate Roll in an attempt to improve a critically failed Stealth test. An Aura ML 75 and a Physical group +10 bonus equals EML 70 (50 + 10 + 10)-a roll of 65 results in a CS Fate Roll. The player decides to expend one Fate Point and improve the CF Stealth two success levels, to an S.

Also, since the Fate Roll was a CS, Elben has the chance for a Lucid Dream later while sleeping. The d20 roll is 18against Elbin's AUR15, this results in a Lucid Dream lasting two rounds. Before the astral journey begins, another d20 is rolled-15-failure, so Elben's dream does not attract a Saviris.

At the end of the brief spirit journey, Elben will make a Reembodiment Roll, perhaps becoming awakened and fatigued by the strange experience. Was it all just a dream?

## [2] Inhabit the Soul

If lifting the veil proves successful, the astralist now inhabits the soul and shifts perspective to the spirit world.

## [2.�] spirit world attributes

An astral in the spirit world does not express physical attributes-their utility is lost with the change of inhabitation from body to soul. The six physical attributes find near analogues in specific mental attributes:

| str   | end   | dex   | agl   | per   | cml   |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| aur   | wil   | rea   | cre   | emp   | elo   |

str to aur : how powerful a presence the soul has in spirit world is measured by AUR. The higher the AUR, the stronger the tie is to the spirit world and the more easily the soul lifts the veil to access it. An old sage with great spiritual strength is quite imposing in the astralscape.

end to wil : unlike the body, the soul is immortal. So, while END measures in part the earthly ability to withstand injury, WIL expresses the soul's ability to cope with spiritual trauma and determines an astral's stamina to remain in the astralscape.

dex to rea : while in most ways an experience beyond earthly rationality, an astral journey sometimes allows an astral the chance to examine and manipulate the astralscape's phenomena, such as ethereal energy.

agl to cre : a higher CRE allows an entity to navigate better the spirit world. It embodies the inventiveness that propels the soul through the strange astralscape and helps it avoid the various pitfalls.

per to emp : the ability to perceive reality in the spirit world is measured by EMP. The lights, colours, and vastness of the astralscape are felt emotionally, rather than seen, heard, smelled, or touched literally.

cml to elo : the typical earthly guise of beauty in the physical world instead manifests in the spirit world as a clarity of thought. While no audible speech transpires, telepathically expressed ideas can impact other souls with ineffable and celestial charm.

## [2.2] skill use

With the loss of physical attributes, astrals may not test skills containing a physical attribute in the skill base. They can test most lore skills, but some have no application in the astralscape ( Engineering ). Spells and invocations by definition function through the channelling of ethereal energy into the physical world, and so spellcasting and invoking do not work within the astralscape.

Trauma : injury and fatigue only affect the functioning of a being's body. Their effects do not apply to astrals in the spirit world-but still might to their body (like bleeding).

## [2.3] spiritworld time

While the spirit world is eternal, it still exhibits a correspondence with the passage of time in the physical world. For the purposes of an astral journey, one spirit round takes five seconds in the physical world, the same length as a combat round:

one spirit round  =  five seconds

## [2.4] astral locale

In the astralscape souls can cover vast distances with a speed unnatural to the physical world. An astral journey begins in the vicinity of the left-behind physical body, or, in the case of dematerialisation, where the body last

resided. Such an astral locale corresponds to approximately the environment encompassed by a standard Local Map published by Kelestia Productions-that is, within about 1000 feet of the soul.

Within the given locale, the soul may begin to Engage the Spirit World (step 3). This includes attempting to interpret the surrounding astralscape or even move to another astral locale anywhere on the world of Kethira.

Dormant souls : the dormant souls of beings reside in the astral locale that corresponds to where their bodies are active in the physical world.

## [3] Engage the Spirit World

Souls take turns in order of an Initiative Rank equal to their Spirit ML. On its turn a soul engages the astralscape by taking one of five spirit actions . Each tests Spirit ML, with four of them including a Secondary Modifier:

| spiritworldactions   |   step | test                |
|----------------------|--------|---------------------|
| SpiritRoaming        |    3.1 | Spirit (Creativity) |
| Spirit Sensing       |    3.2 | Spirit (Empathy)    |
| SpiritCommuning      |    3.3 | Spirit (Eloquence)  |
| Spirit Immersion     |    3.4 | Spirit (Reasoning)  |
| Spirit Conflict      |    3.5 | Spirit              |

Every time a special circumstance makes a spirit action happen instantaneously, the soul may immediately take another spirit action on the same turn.

Astrals may usually maintain an astral journey for a number of rounds equal to Will Index, after which they must make a Reembodiment Roll (step 4).

## maximum spirit rounds  =  will index

Some methods might modify or even determine maximum length differently. Astrals may also cut short the journey by voluntarily making the Reembodiment Roll on their turn.

Spirits are not subject to the Will Index limit. They still make tests to perform spirit actions, but spirits are able to act in the astralscape forever.

## soul conditions

All souls are considered to be in one of three conditions at any given moment-active, dormant, or dissolved.

| active    | The entity inhabits its soul and is able to take spirit actions. This is the natural condition of spirits-and of astrals during a spirit journey. Somebeings can be partially active, such as a medium(page262).                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dormant   | This is the usual status of folk and beasts-their soul is uninhabited and severely limited in spirit actions. Abeing in the physical worldmayonly partake in Spirit Conflict if targeted by an active soul; otherwise, nospirit actions are allowed.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| dissolved | The entity's soul maytakenospirit actionsandmay not be sensed or targeted. Such dissolution lasts a numberofdays, varying according to the source. • Whendissolution ends, a spirit becomes active. • Adissolved astral immediately reembodies (step 4) and then accrues one level of Aural Shock per day of dissolution (page 190). • A being in the physical world whosedormantsoul is dissolved suffers Aural Shock. |

## [3.�] spirit roaming

Souls take a Spirit Roaming action to propel themselves from their current astral locale to another one. Each attempt to roam takes one spirit action, no matter how vast the corresponding distance is in the physical world. Note that roaming in the current astral locale-roughly within 1000 feet-requires no test. As long as the soul is active, such small moves are a free action.

How easily souls navigate depends on their grasp of the astralscape's strange nature, an insight measured by the Creativity modifier to the Spirit Roaming test.

Unfamiliarity : apply -20 penalty if the entity roams to a locale it has never visited in the spirit or physical world.

## spirit roaming

## spirit (creativity) test

- cf� astral trap :	the	soul	blunders	into	a	bizarre	anomaly	in	the astralscape	and	suffers	dissolution	for	d3	days.
- cf5 astral drift : the soul fails to roam and must succeed on a CRE test at	the	end	of	next	turn	to	resume	the	journey.	Test each	round	until	successful	or	forced	to	reembody	(step	4).
- f The	soul	fails	to	roam	but	may	try	again	next	round.
- s The	soul	roams	to	the	desired	locale.
- cs The	soul	roams	to	the	desired	locale	instantaneously.

## exploring the astralscape

Roaming to locales in the spirit world is not unlike travelling to places in the physical world-it just happens in a matter of seconds rather than days, months, or years. An astral undertaking such an exploration first picks a direction to go and then makes a Spirit Roaming test, with a -20 penalty if the destination is not familiar.

If successful, the GM describes broadly the astralscape as the soul hurtles through it. Mountains and oceans still loom quite large if only strangely recognisable. Should the astral explorer wish to stop in a particular astral locale and interpret a specific feature, the round's Spirit Roaming action comes to an end-proceed to step 3.2.

a

Roaming Example : the Kuboran shaman Tyrus enters a trance and lifts the veil. Now inhabiting his soul, Tyrus senses his unconscious body in the astral locale that corresponds to the secluded glen near his home in the physical world where he entered the trance.

Tyrus wishes to commune with a tribal ancestor spirit guide who inhabits a familiar locale in the astralscape at a hallowed mountain peak about 20 miles away. He tests Spirit (CRE Mod) to roam there and succeeds (S). The intervening astralscape streaks by wondrously and he arrives at the desired locale just seconds later. With a Will Index 7, he has six rounds left.

## [3.2] spirit sensing

Interpreting the spirit world is called Spirit Sensing, an action modified by the soul's depth of feeling (EMP). Souls most often attempt Spirit Sensing to identify an unknown phenomenon (such as a bundle of energy or a stranger's soul); or to find a known or familiar one (such as a shaman's spirit guide). Such detailed sensing of the astralscape is limited to the soul's current astral locale.

Dormancy : apply -20 penalty if the target is a dormant soul. A dissolved soul cannot be sensed.

Unfamiliarity : apply -20 penalty if the testing soul has never sensed the target soul's True Form.

Radiance : apply the target soul's AUR Secondary Modifier. If the target is an object with no AUR, apply -40 penalty. If the target is ethereal energy, apply +20 bonus.

## spirit sensing

## spirit (empathy) test

- cf Phenomenon	quite	confounding.	Soul	must	succeed	on	an EMP	test	at	the	end	of	next	turn	to	act	(one	test	per	round).
- f Phenomenon	not	understood	or	found	(retest	allowed).
- s Phenomenon	understood	or	found.	If	the	target	is	a	soul,	its True	Form	is	sensed	by	the	tester.
- cs Phenomenon	understood	or	found	instantaneously.	If	the target	is	a	soul,	its	True	Form	is	sensed	by	the	tester.

## physical world targets

A soul in the spirit world does not test Perception or Awareness to 'see into' the physical world. Instead, they test Spirit (Empathy) to feel the impression the target entity makes on the astralscape from its own place in the physical world. The higher the Aura, the stronger the impression, as implied by the Radiance modifier (above).

## semi-corporeal sensing

Entities that are semi-corporeal in the physical world can sometimes achieve genuine two-way perception. If so, they test Spirit (Empathy) to sense the astralscape; and Perception and Awareness to perceive the physical world.

a

Sensing Example : Tyrus arrives at the mountain locale of his ancestor spirit guide. He takes a Spirit Sensing action to ascertain the spirit guide's active soul, which Tyrus has sensed before on previous journeys:

-  Tyrus Spirit ML 89
-  Tyrus Empathy Secondary Modifier -5
-  Target Aura Secondary Modifier +10

The EML 94 test roll is 97 (F). This costs one action but Tyrus may try again. The next roll is 32 (S)-he recognises the soul of his ancestor spirit guide. This took two actions, leaving Tyrus four rounds.

## [3.3] spirit communing

An active soul who successfully senses another soul may communicate with it by making a Spirit Communing test. A being's languages are immaterial-all communing between souls is akin to telepathy. The clarity of the communer's thought (ELO) modifies the Spirit test.

Dormancy : if the target is dormant, then the communer may only impart general emotions or feelings, such as fear , danger , or anger . If the Spirit Communing test succeeds, dormant souls still must then succeed on a Spirit test to register the feeling-and, even so, they never get to reply. A dissolved soul cannot be communed with.

Eloquence : an entity with no ELO may not attempt communing-but may be targeted as if dormant (above).

Estrangement : apply a modifier according to the relationship the communer holds with the target entity (right), such as a shaman has with spirit guides. Unfamiliar, dormant souls are usually Hostile to communing.

| Hostile   |   -20 |
|-----------|-------|
| Unpopular |   -10 |
| Accepted  |     0 |
| Popular   |   +10 |
| Favoured  |   +20 |

## spirit communing

## spirit (eloquence) test

- cf Communication fails for the turn and Spirit Estrangement is reduced	one	level.	If	brought	to	or	already	Hostile,	then	Spirit Conflict	(step	3.5)	erupts	with	an	active	soul	target.	Dormant souls	simply	remain	Hostile.
- f Communication	fails	for	the	turn.
- s Communication	succeeds	for	the	turn.
- cs Communication	succeeds	instantaneously.

## active soul targets

If the Spirit Communing test succeeds, an active soul target understands and may immediately make a Spirit Communing test to respond if it wishes. The original tester's turn then ends, no matter the response result (except in the case of an original CS, which grants the original tester another spirit action on this same turn).

a

Communing Example : Tyrus has perceived his spirit guide and now wishes to petition for an ancestor spirit power. He intends to gain an Anima II Earth Spirit power for the Herblore skill (as explained on page 306).

-  Tyrus Spirit ML 89
-  Tyrus Eloquence Secondary Modifier 0
-  Target Estrangement Popular +10

The EML 99 (95) test roll is 25 (CS). Not only does the petition succeed, but it does not cost Tyrus a spirit action-he still has four rounds remaining.

astral journey

## [3.4] spirit immersion

Active souls can meld themselves with principle or place features that they have successfully sensed in the astralscape. Shamans attempt such Spirit Immersion in order to acquire Energy Spirit Powers (page 305). Others may try to immerse themselves, but failing is especially traumatic-the primordial energies can psychically overwhelm less astute minds.

Spirit Immersion is a test of Spirit (Reasoning) .

Place Energy : souls suffer -20 penalty when immersing with the ethereal energies associated with Place features.

## spirit immersion

## spirit (reasoning) test

- cf Immersion fails; the soul suffers d6 Psyche	Stress	levels and then	dissolution	for	d6	days.
- f Immersion fails; the soul must succeed on a Reasoning test at the	end	of	next	turn	to	resume	actions	(one	test	per	round). Each	REA	test	failure	inflicts	1	(F)	or	2	(CF)	Psyche	Stress	levels	.
- s Immersion	succeeds.
- cs Immersion	succeeds	instantaneously.

## principle immersion

Principle energy in the astralscape takes form as one of the six elements: Earth, Metal, Fire, Air, Aura, or Water. A successful immersion test has the following effects.

Sunsign Intensification : the soul adjusts its Sunsign modifier related to the principle energy by 5 for 30 days. If the modifier is currently positive, increase it by 5; if it is negative, decrease it by 5. If 0, there is no effect. Multiple immersions during the same 30 days do not combine. See page 22 for the Sunsign Modifiers table.

Example : a soul with the Nadai sunsign successfully immerses with Fire principle. The immersion increases the +10 Sunsign Modifier associated with Combat/Fire/Peleahn to +15. If the soul's sunsign were Skorus, the immersion would have decreased the modifier to -15.

Shamanic Power : a petitioning shaman's soul may also receive the related Energy Spirit Power (page 305).

## place immersion

Place Energy impacts the astralscape on a much larger scale and so immersing with it is more dramatic. First, each place associated with a specific principle also has the same two effects as Principle Immersion (above). Second, Place Energy is a unique phenomenon and thus imparts its own special effect from immersion. For several examples, refer to the Place Energy entry in Chapter 7: Bestiary (page 398).

## [3.5] spirit conflict

An active soul may take the Spirit Conflict action against a soul it senses in order to inflict dissolution. Only active souls in the spirit world may initiate Spirit Conflict, but living entities in either the spirit or physical world may fully respond when targeted , even as a dormant soul.

Once the conflict starts, each entity-whether initiator or target-chooses one of these options on its own turn:

| attack          | The entity calls for an opposed Spirit test , resolved on the Spirit Conflict table, below.   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| pass            | The entity does nothing. NoopposedSpirit test takes place on the entity's turn.               |
| physical action | Beings inhabiting their body maychoosearegular physical world action (page 161).              |
| spirit action   | Anactive soul maychooseoneofthefour other spirit actions (steps 3.1 to 3.4).                  |

Although the same entity can be targeted by several active souls, there is no spirit 'outnumbered penalty'-each paired conflict is resolved separately from turn to turn.

Native Soul : beings who inhabit their natural bodies and have a perspective in the physical world increase Spirit tests by 1 success level when attacked , but not when they attack on their own turn. In either case, Native Souls accrue 5 windedness fatigue per opposed roll.

Natural Spirits : active souls who have no natural body in the physical world may seek possession of a target's body if they are victorious in spirit conflict (page 297). The demonic Gytevshai may also express other unique powers when they win an opposed Spirit Conflict (page 397).

## spirit conflict

## opposed spirit test

- The	losing	soul	suffers	dissolution.
- A	spirit's	soul	is	dissolved	for	one	day	per	loss	star.
- An	astral	immediately	reembodies	(step	4)	and	then	suffers Aural	Shock	equal	to	the	number	of	loss	stars.
- A	being	in	the	physical	world	suffers	Aural	Shock	equal	to the	number	of	loss	stars.
- Break	tied	successes.	Tied	failures	have	no	effect.

## spirit shadow

An entity with the Shadow of Bukrai exudes its full Shadow Strength in the astralscape (page 377). However, the Shadow only affects others during spirit conflict (or immersion!). Merely being in the same astral locale as the Shadow has no effect.

## artefacts

Possession	and	animation	of	arcane	artefacts	is	possible	but	limited.

- Major artefacts with Will Volition can	be	possessed	by dissolving	their	souls	through	Spirit	Conflict.	Such	an	artefact	can then	be	animated	as	an	object.
- Major artefacts with Ego Volition can	be	animated	as	objects. However,	the	Animation	test	subtracts	the	artefact's	Ego ×5.
- Minor artefacts can	be	animated	as	objects.

Latent enchantments	cannot	be	invoked	because	touch	is	not possible	by	the	possessor. Continuous enchantments	work	in	minor and	major	artefacts,	with	Ego,	but	not	in	artefacts	with	Will	while their	souls	are	dissolved	by	the	possessor.

## possession

A spirit with	an	active	soul	in	the	spirit	world	and	no	natural	body in	the	physical	world	may	inhabit	the	body	of	a	being	whose	soul	it dissolves in	Spirit	Conflict-this	is	called possession .	The	spirit	must be	in	the	same	astral	locale	as	the	body	and	the	possession	must	be made	on	the	same	turn	as	the	dissolution,	or	the	opportunity	is	lost.

- A	spirit	who	is	currently	incarnating	a	form	in	the	physical	world (such	as	a	V'hir)	or	binding	to	natural	energy	in	the	physical	world (such as an Elemental) has a dormant soul and so cannot initiate the	spirit	conflict	required	for	possession	or	animation .
- A	dematerialised	body	is	not	subject	to	possession.

Possessor :	upon	choosing	to	possess,	the	entity	inhabits	the	target's body	and	switches	perspective	to	the	physical	world.	Its	own	soul then	becomes	dormant.	The	possessor	retains	its	own	personality	but is now in control of	the	target's	body,	acquiring	its	physical	attributes and	its	Mastery	Levels	(ML)	in	the	following	skills:

| Acrobatics   | Dancing     | Melee Shock   | Stealth   |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Archery      | Dodge       |               | Swimming  |
| Awareness    | Jumping     | Singing       | Throwing  |
| Climbing     | Legerdemain | Sling         |           |

Possessors	also	gain	any	special	characteristics	or	abilities	based entirely	on	the	body's	physique,	such	as	movement	and	scent.	While in	possession	of	the	body,	possessors	are	considered	corporeal.

Possessed :	the	possessed	entity's	personality	still	inhabits	its	body and	perceives	the	physical	world.	However,	the	personality	is mute , unable	to	control	its	body	and	thus	unable	to	speak.

After	recovering	from	the	Aural	Shock	and	dissolution	caused	by possession,	the	being's	soul	returns	to	dormancy.	The	being	may	then attempt	to	overcome	the	possession	by	winning	a	new	Spirit	Conflict.

## possession duration

Possession lasts until one of the following occurs:

- The possessor voluntarily reinhabits	its	soul.
- The possessor loses	Spirit	Conflict -either with the possessed being (see	Possession	Recovery,	page	190)	or	through	some	other	means (see	Exorcism	box,	right).	The	possessor	then	reinhabits	its	soul.
- The possessed body dies .	The	possessor	then	reinhabits	its	soul.

When	possession	ends,	the	possessed	being	regains	control	of	its body,	no	matter	whether	its	soul	is	dormant	or	dissolved.	If	active	in the	spirit	world,	the	being	must	reinhabit	its	body	to	regain	control.

a

## exorcism

A	living	entity	attempting	to	end	or	help	end	an	invading	entity's possession or animation is called exorcism .	There	are	a	variety	of approaches to exorcism-characters might be able to self-exorcise even	while	possessed	and	mute	themselves.

- Arcanists who	successfully	cast	Personality	(Neutral	VI)	can remove	a	possessor.	Arcanists	who	successfully	cast	Aural	Blast (Savorya	V)	or	invoke	Aural	Bolt	(page	261)	can	dissolve	the possessor's	soul,	ending	possession.
- Astrals on	a	spirit	journey	may	enter	Spirit	Conflict	to	dissolve the	invader.	This	might	be	an	invoker	with	the	Medium	or Disembodiment	talent	or	a	shaman	using	Trance.
- Priests can	undertake	the	Exorcism	ritual	devotion	to	help beings	overcome	possession.	Such	a	mystery	is	only	available	to certain	religions	at	specific	Circles	of	Command	(page	320).

## animation

A spirit with	an	active	soul	in	the	spirit	world	and	no	natural	body in	the	physical	world	may	inhabit	an	object	as	a	free	action.	This	is called animation (a	dead	body	so	animated	is	often	called	a zombie). No	Spirit	Conflict	is	required,	but	the	spirit	must	first	have	succeeded on	a	Spirit	Sensing	action	to	recognise	accurately	the	object's	physical world	guise	projected	in	the	astralscape.

Animator :	the	animating	soul	inhabits	the	object	and	may	attempt to	cause	it	to	do	things	natural	to	the	object's	structure.	For	instance, an	animator	could	open	a	book-but	not	hurl	it	across	the	room.	Each attempt requires the spirit to test Spirit as	a	1-turn	action.

- Apply	-10	penalty	for	every	full	50	pounds	the	object	weighs.
- If	the	object	is	a	major	artefact	with	Ego	Volition,	apply	a	penalty equal	to	Ego ×5.

## animation test

## spirit ml

- cf No effect and animation lost; spirit must retest Spirit Sensing to even perceive	the	target	again.
- f No	effect.
- s Animation	succeeds.	Creatures	who	clearly	witness	the	actions	of the	animated	object	might	have	to	make	a	Fear	Roll,	depending	on how	unexpected	it	is.	Consult	the Manifestation table (page 396) for guidance-animation	might	appear	like	ghostly	phenomena.
- cs Same	as	Success	(S),	but	the	Spirit	test	was	just	as	a	free	action.

Animated :	with	no	soul,	an	object	has	no	defence	against	animation. However,	it	can	only	perform	actions	its	structure	is	designed	to	do. This	likely	makes	the	animation	of	some	objects	rather	tame.

Example 1 : animating a rock generates few options. Forcing it to hover or even roll on its own would instead require the Telekinesis arcane talent. Otherwise, a rock just naturally stays where it is.

Example 2 : opening a locked door requires the animation of two separate objects-one to animate the lock to move its bolt, and then a separate animation to swing the door open (both natural acts of its design).

## animation duration

Animation lasts until the animator rolls a CF or until one of the same happens	as	for	ending	possession	(see	Possession	Duration).

astral journey

## immersion example

Tyrus has four rounds left on his spirit journey at the hallowed mountain. He wishes now to attempt Spirit Immersion with the Air Principle Energy at the same locale. Such immersion also serves as a petition for an Air Spirit Power (page 305).

He first attempts Spirit Sensing to identify the energy (step 3.2). The EML 104 (95) test roll is 48 (S). He now attempts the Spirit Immersion action, a test of Spirit (Reasoning). The EML 99 (95) test roll is 88 (S). With a Taræl sunsign, Tyrus successfully petitions for an Air Spirit Power and also increases by 5 his current +10 Physical/Air/Lyahvi sunsign bonus.

With two rounds left, Tyrus decides to lower the veil as a free action. A successful Spirit test (S) and Trance SR leave him reembodied and conscious with no accrued fatigue (the final CS result).

## death

A being is a living entity with both a soul in the spirit world and a body in the physical world. Death severs the soul's connection to the body and the soul departs on a special astral journey, the complexity of which varies according to the kind of being.

Plants : a dead plant's soul survives in the astralscape that corresponds to where it once lived. Given its extremely low Aura, its presence in the astralscape upon death is nearly imperceptible.

Creatures : the souls of dead creatures either remain in the spirit world or embark on an afterlife journey similar to that of folk.

Folk : the prevailing view of many cultures is that the souls of folk who die on Kethira-and who receive a satisfactory burial according to custom-automatically undertake an astral journey to the afterworld called Yashain. Here, they are either reborn there immortal or attempt to return to Kethira reincarnated.

Ghost : if a body suffers a particularly traumatic death, then the being often becomes a ghost. The spirit's motives are usually limited to haunting the place where it died or was most attached to in life (page 396).

Shade : some beings who die become a type of free-willed ghost, quite aware of their situation. These include astrals who die during an astral journey, mages who suffer a transformative Total Release, and spiritual wise folk who elect to remain in the astralscape upon death, such as tribal Ancestor Spirits.

The most powerful Kethiran esotericists have yet to master true 'resurrection', although Morgathians argue the point. More tellingly, neither have the wondrous powers of Earthmaster objects replicated or mimicked it.

## [4] Lowering the Veil

Astrals may voluntarily shift inhabitation and perspective back to their body in the physical world as a free action at the start of any turn during an astral journey. This is called lowering the veil . It also happens instantaneously once their maximum number of spirit rounds have elapsed, or if they suffer dissolution during the journey.  To lower the veil, the astral tests Spirit on the Reembodiment Roll table (below).

Astral Dissolution : an astral who suffers dissolution is required to make a Reembodiment test, after which the character accrues Aural Shock levels equal to the days of dissolution. However, the soul remains dissolved until the character recovers from the Aural Shock (page 190).

Trance : a successful Trance SR increases the Spirit test of the Reembodiment roll by one success level.

## reembodiment roll

## spirit (trance sr) test

- cf Astral	inhabits	the	body	Stunned	and	accrues	20	weariness	fatigue . Perspective	shifts	to	physical	world.
- f Astral	inhabits	the	body	Stunned and	accrues	10	weariness	fatigue. Perspective	shifts	to	physical	world.
- s Astral	inhabits	the	body	Conscious	and	accrues	5	weariness	fatigue. Perspective	shifts	to	physical	world.
- cs Astral	inhabits	the	body	Conscious . P erspective	shifts	to	physical	world.

Physical Trauma :	once	reembodied	in	the	physical	world,	characters	also	resume suffering	from	other	fatigue	and	impairment	that	had	been	accrued	before	the astral	journey.

## rematerialisation

If the body had dematerialised while Lifting the Veil at the start of the astral journey (step 1), then the body rematerialises at the same place upon reembodiment.
