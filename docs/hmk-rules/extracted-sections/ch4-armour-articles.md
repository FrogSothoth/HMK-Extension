# Armour Articles

## Armour Articles

Characters can be outfitted with individual articles of clothing and armour in order to augment the existing twelve suits on pages 113-116 or to create new combinations that reflect various styles and traditions. Select from the Armour &amp; Clothing Articles table on page 118, and pay close attention to the following rules concerning layer restrictions.

## Layer Restrictions

Only certain material combinations may be worn on top of each other without inducing what is called a Bulk penalty . Such layer restrictions are checked separately for each Body Zone and Location. So, first, group selected articles according to whether they cover the head locations, the arm locations, the torso , or the legs . Note that the coverage of some articles can place them in more than one such zone.

Next, choose one of the four Body Zones and single out the article that serves as the most prominent layer and that covers at least one of the Body Zone's locations. Then, locate the article's material in the brown-shaded base column of the Armour Layers table to the right. The abbreviations-C, L, D, Q, G, K, S, M, P-refer to the nine Armour Materials explained on page 111.

The materials shown in the two columns to the left of the base material may be worn under the chosen article; those in the two columns to the right may be worn over it. Lastly, check for these restrictions to avoid a Bulk penalty:

- A Body Location may consist of no more than five layers.
- Only one layer of either D or Q is allowed per five layers; if they show up in two columns, select only one column.
- For columns listing at least two materials (KP, CD, CDQ), only one article of one of the materials may be chosen.
- [ kp ] means only arm and leg articles are allowed.
- Articles selected in the last, pink-shaded over column are limited to Cloak , Mantle , Vest , Surcoat , Coat , Robe , or Cuisse -and if the article is D or Q material, add 5 ENC.

## bulk penalty

One article per Body Zone of Cloth (C) or Padded (D) may be worn that violates at least one of the above restrictions, but it induces a -5 Bulk penalty to tests requiring the Body Zone covered, cumulative with each applicable Zone. Thus, a C or D article covering locations in both the arms and torso that violates at least one layer restriction induces a -10 penalty to Impaired tests (-5 for the arms and -5 for the torso). See Impaired Tests in the sidebar of page 170 for an explanation of which Body Zones affect which actions. No additional articles of any other material may be donned, even in violation-they simply cannot be worn.

Special : Bulk penalty applies independently of Encumbrance and is unaffected by the ENC modifier from Strength (page 112).

Layer Restrictions Example : Obris wears the Mail Habergeon suit (page 115). Having Strength 12, Obris suffers 5 ENC (the suit's 10 ENC offset by his -5 STR modifier). The player wishes to include additional articles for Obris' upcoming trek through cold alpine mountains. The player checks the current layer restrictions of the four Body Zones:

head : the suit has a Plate helm with a Padded cap underneath. This is allowed with Plate as the base (P) because of the CD column to its left-the D is chosen here, for the Padded cap. He can wear a Cloth (C) head piece underneath this, as indicated in the first column, and so adds a Cloth Cowl.

torso : the suit includes a Mail habergeon with a Padded coat underneath. Cloth breeches reach up to the Pelvis location but the shading of the Armour &amp; Clothing Articles table indicates they are considered part of the Legs Body Zone. With Mail (M) as the base material, the Padded coat (D) can be worn under it, as indicated by the column to the left of the base (second column).

arms : this zone consists of only the Mail habergeon (M) and Padded (D) coat underneath-allowed as for the Torso.

legs : the suit includes four articles here-Cloth breeches, Padded leggings, Kurbul kneecops, and Leather boots. These articles require two independent restriction checks: 1) the Cloth (C) breeches may be worn under base Padded (D) leggings in all their shared locations, and the Kurbul (K) kneecops can go over the base Padded (D) in the knees location; and 2) the Padded (D) leggings can be worn under the base Leather (L) boots.

Obris adds a Padded coat for the cold trek. While it reaches over the thighs, the shading of the Armour &amp; Clothing Articles table indicates that a coat belongs to only the Arms and Torso zones. A Padded (D) coat is allowed over Mail (M) by the second over column, but it adds 5 ENC, raising ENC penalty to 10. As the second Padded (D) material in both Arms and Torso, the coat also violates a restriction, in two zones, for a -10 Bulk penalty.

## Layer Combinations

To help players more readily understand the above Armour Layers table, all the possible combinations that do not induce a Bulk penalty are listed in the Layer Combinations table on page 119.

<!-- image -->

price (pr) the		article's	cost	in	silver	pennies. Cloth and padded reflect	materials worn	by	those	with	Wealth	6.	Multiply	prices	by	a	proportional	amount	to reflect	a	different	social	class	( Standing table,	page	52).	Thus,	gentry cloth and padded articles (Wealth 18) cost three times	as	much	(6 × 3 = 18).

pounds (lb) the	weight	in	pounds,	shown	for	using	precise	amounts	rather than	the	Armour	estimate	(page	122	sidebar)	when	articles	are	stored	as	gear.

encumbrance (enc) how	much	ENC	penalty	the	article	imparts	when worn due	to	materials,	weight,	construction,	and	body	location.

a wearing	three	or	more	arm	articles	produces	ENC5.

p -5	penalty	to	Perception-based	skill	tests,	the	result	of	sensory	restrictions from	certain	headgear.

p -10	penalty	to	Perception-based	skill	tests,	as	above.

⚫   the	body	locations	protected	by	the	article.

the	body	locations	protected	by	Rigid	Armour	(page	111).	Notice	that Gambeson	offers	such	protection	in	only	the	Torso,	not	the	Arms	or	Neck.

⚫ 	 article	protects	only	to	the	rear;	ignore	AV	when	facing	one	aware	foe. Against	multiple	foes,	AV	applies	50%	of	the	time	(d10	roll	versus	TN5).

⚫ 	 article	protects	only	to	the	front;	ignore	AV	when	caught	unaware	from	rear. Against	multiple	foes,	AV	applies	70%	of	the	time	(d10	roll	versus	TN7).

indicates	which	of	the	four	Body	Zones-Head,	Arms,	Torso,	Legs-a location	belongs	to	for	calculating	proper	Layer	Restrictions	(page	117).	For example,	the	Thighs	are	considered	part	of	the	Legs	zone	when	wearing Quilted	Cuisses,	but	part	of	the	Torso	zone	when	wearing	a	Quilted	Surcoat, because the lower part of the coat hangs suspended clear of leg articles.
