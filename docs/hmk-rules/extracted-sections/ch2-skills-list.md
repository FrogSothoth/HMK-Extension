## [ 2 ] Arcane Talent Skills

Characters who have Arcane Talent-as determined by the d20 Talent roll on page 40-now receive two to four DP for each talent to raise its base SM0 (see sidebar table). Modify further by these two factors:

Dormancy : apply any Dormancy modifier (0 or -1).

Talent : apply any DP awarded from the Talent Generation roll, as noted in the bottom note of the Arcane Talent Possession table (page 40). Each DP beyond SM5 applies instead as a Mastery Boost (sidebar).

## spirit talent

All characters have Spirit SM3. Some may also have received one or two DP from the d20 Talent Roll.

## [ 3 ] Family Skills

Each Occupation on the Occupations table lists a variety of skills appropriate to its nature (pages 42-44). Characters receive 5 DP to develop skills listed on the table corresponding to their Parent Occupation, a reflection of skills learned during childhood.

The maximum DP that can be spent on a Family Skill equals half the number listed next to it in the Occupations table, rounded down.

Example : looking at Man-at-arms as a Parent Occupation, one DP could be spent on Melee (half of 2 equals 1) but none on Initiative (half of 1, rounded down, equals 0).

Native Language : characters freely receive DP in the native language of their birth realm, as shown in their Region table (page 24). See Native Language DP in the sidebar for the exact number.

Native Religion : each religion has its own Ritual skill. Human folk receive one DP in a Ritual skill selected from their native pantheon. See Chapter 6: The Mysteries for details on two sample pantheons-the West Venarian (page 321) and the Cult of the Covenant (page 343).

- Sinai receive three DP in Siem Ritual.
- Kuzhai receive two DP in Sereniel Ritual (see sidebar page 341).
- Other folk might grant more or fewer DP, such as the Emhle of Emelrene (2 DP). The Malakta and Nadi do not express ceremonial or meditative practices and so receive no Ritual DP.

Characters may develop Ritual ML in more than one religion; some scholars do so routinely. However, Morality greatly influences the effective use of a specific Ritual skill as a practicing Follower in its religion. The Religions &amp; Priests section on page 55 guides players through how to finalise the details surrounding the Ritual skill; for now, simply make note of its development during the ensuing stages.

Language &amp; Script Points : some occupations list a number of DP for languages. An entry of Native Language means the DP apply only to the character's native language. An entry of Languages allows the DP to apply to either a native or foreign one. An entry of Script or 2nd or 3rd Script means the DP should be applied to a single script, while an entry of Scripts means the DP may be distributed among any scripts.

## arcane talent dp

The number of DP assigned to each Talent's base SM0 varies by Age Group or whether the character is Kuzhai or Sinai:

| agegrouporfolk   |   dp |
|------------------|------|
| Young            |    2 |
| Mature           |    3 |
| Old/Kúzhai/Sinái |    4 |

## mastery boosts

Development Points might increase a skill's SM several times due to various occupations, backgrounds, and options. However, no SM can go higher than 5 . For each point applied beyond SM 5, the skill is instead raised once on the Mastery Boost table (page 46).

To apply a Mastery Boost, calculate the skill's current Mastery Level (ML), initially equal to SB times SM. Find this ML in the first column of the Mastery Boost table and raise the ML by the amount in the second column.

Example : a character applies one DP to Folklore as a Family skill, raising it to SM2 (the base SM1 listed on the Skills List table plus one). Another point is then applied as an Urban Background skill, raising it further to SM3.

The character next acquires Folklore 3 as an Occupation skill. Since no SM goes beyond 5, the first two points take the SM3 to SM5, and the third gives one Mastery Boost.

If the character's Skill Base (SB) is 14, then Folklore SM5 has ML70 (14 × 5). According to the Mastery Boost table, the Mastery Boost increases ML70 by 5, raising Folklore to ML75.

If Folklore receives another DP , the boost is calculated from ML75, raising it by 5 to ML80.

## native language dp

The number of DP assigned to Native Language generally varies by Parent Social Class or whether the character is Kuzhai or Sinai. Several Parent Occupations provide higher Native Language fluency, as noted:

| classorfolk                   |   dp |
|-------------------------------|------|
| Unfree/Free*/Guilded/Military |    4 |
| Guilded†/Priestly/Noble       |    5 |
| Kúzhai/Sinái                  |    5 |

*A Parent Scholar or Scribe occupation	provides	5	DP . †Applies	only	to	Guilded	Parent Alchemist , Astrologer , Herald , Lexigrapher , Litigant , Mercantyler , Physician , Runemaster ,	and Shek-Pvar occupations.

Fluency : an ML in the 10s or 20s allows for simple, halting communication for a foreign speaker. Raising it into the 30s or 40s reflects the native fluency of a commoner (page 77).

S

Conci

Aura the

## language &amp; script dp

Appendix II (page 424) lists all the languages and scripts of Venarive, dividing them according to language families. Each language and script is its own skill. The DP spent raises the language or script SM by one until SM5, beyond which each works as a Mastery Boost, just like any other skill. However, there is no limit to the number of DP that may be spent from the same source on languages (but not scripts). Thus, a character could spend all 5 DP from Optional Skills on the same language.

## foreign language boost

The first DP spent on learning a foreign language gives the character SM1, plus one for each of the following two applicable factors:

-  The foreign language is in the same language family as the character's native language.
-  The foreign language is a regional language according to the character's birth Realm.

These two increases only apply to the first DP spent; subsequent DP increase SM by one.

Example : a character from the Berema Shire realm in the Emelrene region speaks Emelan natively and spends 1 DP to learn Trierzi. The initial SM1 freely increases to SM2 because Trierzi is a regional language for someone born in Berema Shire (page 24 table). However, Trierzi is from a different language family so there is no further adjustment.

## bonus language points

Extra PC language proficiency usually enhances the game. Unless the campaign's setting is especially isolated, the GM can award PCs bonus DP according to Age Group or Folk to spend on languages (but not scripts). These can be given at any stage; players spend them like other language DP (as discussed above).

| agegrouporfolk   |   bonuslanguagedp |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Young            |                 2 |
| Mature           |                 3 |
| Old/Kúzhai/Sinái |                 4 |

## nolóra: languages

<!-- image -->

Considering the campaign's backstory, the GM decides that Nolora will have travelled to the island of Hârn in her youth, and so awards three bonus DP to spend on its languages. Nolora's player spends two on Hârnic and one on Jarin. While neither are regional languages in her home Emelrene, both Hârnic and Jarin receive the same-family language boost from her native Emelan (see Járind table, page 424). These free one-DP boosts to SM leave her at this stage with Hârnic SM3 and Jarin SM2.

## [ 4 ] Background Skills

Characters have an opportunity to develop certain skills more readily according to the milieu of their childhood. Each character receives 5 DP to improve skills from the Background Skills table that corresponds to their Urban or Rural background (page 46). A City background allows selections from both the Urban and City tables; a Wilderness background gives access to both the Rural and Wilderness tables.

<!-- image -->

Elder Folk : non-human folk usually possess unique Background tables. They may spend the five background DP on their special Folk Background table, as well as the regular Urban/Rural tables.

No more than two DP can be spent on the same Background Skill.

Urban (City) Language Bonus : each DP spent on Languages in the City table grants a pool of 3 DP to develop languages (see also sidebar).

## [ 5 ] Occupation Skills

Characters next receive DP in a specific group of skills based upon their own chosen occupation. These are skills improved during an apprenticeship that lasts into the early Young Age Group.

Each occupation in the Occupational Skills table on pages 42-44 lists the number of DP dedicated to each skill. For example, the Cook occupation grants 3 DP in Herblore.

Improve all the skills in the chosen occupation by precisely the amount of DP given in the Occupations table.

Suboccupation : Priest characters select a suboccuption according to a specific religion (the ten in the table belong to the West Venarian pantheon); Shek-Pvar choose a Primary convocation from among the six given; and Weaponcrafters are either Armourers or Bowyers.

## [ 6 ] Optional Skills

Concurrently with their apprenticeship, characters also receive 5 DP to improve skills of their own choosing. These can be used to improve skills already acquired in a previous stage or to develop new ones.

No more than 1 DP can be spent on the same Optional Skill, unless it has received no DP thus far, in which case it may receive up to 2 DP .

Esoteric Skill Exclusion : Esoterica Group skills may not be developed if they are not already at SM1 or higher after stage 5.

figuring Singing SB (page 46).

## [ 7 ] Veteran Skills

Character generation up to this point reflects the completion of an apprenticeship in the selected occupation. This leaves characters in the early to middle years of the Young group, about 20-29 years old for human folk. Young characters skip stage 7 and move to assigning Sunsign Development Points in stage 8.

Mature and Old characters receive 5 DP to reflect the veteran experience of already having lived through their Young age group.

No more than 1 DP can be spent on the same Veteran Skill, unless it has received no DP thus far, in which case it may receive up to 2 DP .

Esoterica Skill Exclusion : same as for stage 6.

Old Group : after spending the Veteran 5 DP, Old characters receive an additional 5 DP to reflect the experience of their Mature age group years. The same restrictions that affect the first round of Veteran DP apply to this second round.

Elder Folk : given their extended adolescence, both Sinai and Kuzhai are treated as Old for purposes of Veteran DP. That is, they receive two rounds of 5 DP each. Malak and Nadi are treated like humans.

## [ 8 ] Sunsign Skills

The astrological Sunsign under which characters are born subtly affects their skill performance. Once gameplay begins, this influence is captured through the Fate mechanic (page 276). During character generation, it is instead reflected in Sunsign Development Points.

Characters earlier received a number of DP during step 4 of character generation (sidebar page 23). For instance, a Masara Sunsign grants 3 Social, 1 Lore, and 1 Nature DP . The respective DP are now spent on skills within the given skill group-Social DP only on Social Group skills, Nature DP only on Nature Group skills, and so forth.

No more than 1 DP can be spent on the same Sunsign Skill, unless it has received no DP thus far, in which case it may receive up to 2 DP .

## mastery levels

After stage 8 (Sunsign Skills), compute the Mastery Level (ML) of every skill. Characters also have an ML in the skills listed on the Skills List table that have an SM of one or moreeven if no DP were spent on them . These automatic skills are already shown on the character sheet; every character gains them to at least the listed SM level, if not at a higher SM through development.

Attributes : the twelve Attributes each have a Mastery Level (ML) equal to its generated score multiplied by five (ATT × 5). A STR12 has ML60, for instance. An Attribute ML can be tested with a d100 roll just like a Skill ML-see pages 60-62.

The section on the next page explains the eight stages of Nolora's Skill Development, including the calculations of Mastery Levels. Character generation continues with step 13 in the Standing section on page 51.

## subskills

Shock is a subskill of Initiative. It improves according to the SM increase of Initiative, but it uses its own unique SB and derives its own unique ML. The Shock subskill receives a Mastery Boost when Initiative does, figured separately according to its own ML.

Example : a character with SB10 in Initiative and SB16 in Shock has spent two DP to raise Initiative SM from 3 to 5. This produces an Initiative ML50 and Shock ML80. When a single Mastery Boost is later applied, Initiative increases to ML57 (50 + 7) and Shock to ML84 (80 + 4).

Dodge is a subskill of Melee. The same above rule regarding Shock and Initiative applies to Dodge and Melee. That is, DP are only spent on Melee, and its SM is also applied to Dodge.

Melee could instead be developed according to eight different weapon groups. Gamers who prefer this approach could incorporate the Required Expertise option (page 92).

## singing (voice)

Singing involves a unique physiological talent little related to one's speaking voice. PCs have a physical trait called Voice (VOI), generated with 4d6 (drop lowest), or 5d6 (drop two lowest) for Sinai. VOI is paired with Creativity (CRE) when figuring Singing SB ( page 46).

## nolóra: skill development

Nolora's	player	works	through	the	eight	stages	of	Skill	Development (pages	45-49).	This	process	gives	a	broad	picture	of	the	character's life	before	the	start	of	the	campaign.

[�] Folk :	Humans	(Emhle)	receive	no	Folk	skills.

[�] Talent :	she	receives	the	Prescience	talent	with	a	-1	Dormancy modifier	because	a	20	was	rolled	and	she	has	AUR	9	(page	40).	She also	receives	+2	SM	to	the	Spirit	skill.	With	a	Mature	Group	age,	her starting SM for these two Talents equal:

Prescience	2

Spirit	5

[�] Family : the Hunter occupation allows for potential development among	six	different	family	skills	(page	42).	The	player	puts	2	DP into	Tracking	and	1	DP	each	into	Survival,	Archery,	and	Hideworking (Survival	and	Archery	already	start	at	SM1).	Nolora's	Free	social	class gives	her	Native	Language	SM4.	As	an	Emhle,	she	has	Ritual	SM2	in	a religion	of	the	Cult	of	the	Covenant	pantheon	(page	343).

[�] Background :	as	a	member	of	a	Tribal	society,	Nolora	may	spend 5	DP	on	skills	from	both	the	Rural	and	Wilderness	background tables	(page	46).	These	are	skills	likely	developed	as	an	adolescent, a reflection of Nolora roaming the vast forests of the Jerinalian Mountains.

[�] Occupation :	the	player	returns	to	the	Hunter	table	to	locate Nolora's	own	Occupation	skills	(page	42).	She	simply	assigns	the precise	DP	given	for	each	skill.	Both	Tracking	and	Survival	receive their	last	DP	as	a	Mastery	Boost,	since	no	skill	may	exceed	SM5.

[�] Options :	the	player	decides	Nolora	saw	action	battling	strange creatures	near	her	lodge	during	her	teenage	apprenticeship.	She spends 1 DP to improve Initiative and 2 DP on Melee-because it is a new	skill,	Melee	may	receive	two	points	(page	48).

Initiative	4

Melee	4

She	also	raises	two	skills	already	developed	by	spending		1	DP	on	each of	them.	The	DP	spent	on	Archery	gives	a	Mastery	Boost	since	it	had been at the maximum SM5:

Awareness	5

Bonus Language DP : the GM decides that Nolora was selected in her	Young	Age	Group	to	take	part	in	a	special	Emhle	diplomatic mission	that	travelled	to	the	island	of	Hârn.	To	reflect	her	time	and experiences	there,	she	is	awarded	three	bonus	Language	DP .	The player	spends	them	on	Hârnic	(2)	and	Jarin	(1):

Hârnic	3	(2	DP	+	1	family	bonus)

Jarin	2	(1	DP	+	1	family	bonus)

The	+1	bonuses	reflect	the	shared	language	family	with	Emelan.

<!-- image -->

[�] Veteran : Nolora receives five veteran DP as a Mature Group character,	the	result	of	experiences	throughout	her	twenties.	She improves	Nolora's	fighting	prospects	by	assigning	1	DP	to	two different	combat	skills.

Initiative	5

She	similarly	raises	her	arcane	talent	with	1	DP .

Prescience	3

The	player	wishes	to	improve	an	important	skill	for	a	hunterStealth.	Since	she	has	yet	to	spend	any	DP	on	Stealth,	she	is	allowed to	put	2	DP	into	it.

[�] Sunsign :	the	player	spends	Nolora's	Sunsign	DP	(Craft	3,	Nature 1,	and	Combat	1).	Biographically,	this	development	could	have	taken place	at	any	point	during	her	backstory.	The	player	decides	all	of	it coincided	with	Nolora's	recent	hunting	exploits.

She	first	chooses	to	improve	three	skills	already	developed: Fletching,	Tracking,	and	Melee.	She	then	puts	2	DP	into	a	brand-new skill,	Woodworking.

## mastery levels

Nolora's	player	now	determines	the	Mastery	Levels	of	all	her	skills. She	computes	each	Skill	Base	(SB),	multiplies	it	by	the	Skill	Multiple (SM),	and	applies	Mastery	Boosts	from	the	table	on	page	46.

ML Example 1 : Nolora's Melee SB is the average of DEX and AGL (SB13 in this	case).	She	developed	it	to	SM5 + 1	Mastery	Boost.	SB13 × SM5 = ML65. One boost raises it by 6 to ML71.

The	player	also	computes the	Mastery	Levels	for	all	the various	automatic	skills	left undeveloped.

ML Example 2 : Nolora never developed the Dancing skill. However,	like	everyone,	she receives it at SM2 as shown on both the Skills List table (page 46) and a blank character sheet. The SB is 12, based on AGL and	CRE	(12 + 11 = 23;	halved to 11.5; rounded up to 12 since AGL is	listed	first	and	is	greater than CRE).	Nolora	starts	the game	with	Dancing	 ML24.

## Standing

A character's standing at the start of a campaign varies broadly by social class. The food, shelter, clothing, and occupational accoutrement reflecting a certain standing is measured by the Wealth characteristic.

<!-- image -->

Roll Wealth Dice as given in the Occupations table	(pages	42-44).

A character's Wealth equals the summed result from rolling a number of polyhedral dice from two different sources (refer to the sidebar tables):

- [1]  Family Wealth Dice : roll a number of dice derived from Family Estrangement of a die size based upon Parent Occupation .
- [2]  Occupation Wealth Dice : roll a number of dice derived from the PC's Age Group of a die size based upon the PC's Occupation . Treat Sinai and Kuzhai as Old.

PC Wealth Advantage : roll an extra die from both Wealth sources and drop the lowest result in each group before totalling. For a demonstration, see the Nolora: Standing sidebar, as well as the example on the following page.

## Lifestyle

The resulting Wealth score is applied on the Standing table on the next page to get a general indication of the character's overall lifestyle with regard to housing, food, and clothing.

## Possessions

Characters may also start with other possessions whose total value in silver pennies (d) does not exceed their Wealth times one hundred:

## possessions value (d)  =  wealth × 100

These acquisitions do not reduce the Wealth score but instead reflect the quality and quantity of belongings the character of a given standing could likely have obtained by the start of the campaign. Chapter 4: Possessions contains an extensive list of weapons, armour, mounts, gear, and vessels.

During character generation, possessions may not be 'cashed in' for money. Strictly speaking, some items are not even owned-a serf's cottage or a noble's subenfeoffed manor-but are still 'possessed'.

Special Gear : see the Weaponcraft entry in Chapter 3: Skills for the cost of masterwork weapons and armour.

Workshops : characters who have at least ML50 in a Craft group skill possess an associated workshop according to Wealth. See Chapter 4: Possessions (page 121) to determine its quality rating.

## Coins

Although actual coins are rare-especially in rural areas-characters also begin the campaign with a number of silver pennies (d) equal to their Wealth score times ten. This money can be further spent or saved.

silver penny coins (d)  =  wealth × 10

## number of wealth dice

| estrangement   |   # | agegroup/folk    |

| Outcast        |   1 | Young            |

| Favourite      |   5 |                  |

## size of wealth dice

Wealth Dice sizes for most occupations are shown in the Occupations table (pages 42-44).

Nobility Wealth Dice sizes vary by specific title:

| nobility title                             | size   |
|--------------------------------------------|--------|
| Gentry (all occupations)                   | d6     |
| Bailiff / Knight Bachelor                  | d8     |
| ManorLord, Appointed ( Bailiff )           | d8     |
| ManorLord, Appointed ( Bailiff [Hundred] ) | d10    |
| ManorLord, Appointed ( Constable )         | d12    |
| ManorLord, Appointed ( Sheriff )           | d20    |
| ManorLord, Enfeoffed                       | d24    |
| Tenant-in-chief (all titles)               | d30    |

Priest Wealth Dice size equals Circle × 2. For Parent Occupation, assume Circle III (d�). PC Circle is determined on page ��.

## nolóra: standing

Nolora's Family Wealth Dice amount to 3d2.

| • Parent Estrangement:                | Accepted                              | 3 dice                                |

| Her Occupation Wealth Dice equal 2d2. | Her Occupation Wealth Dice equal 2d2. | Her Occupation Wealth Dice equal 2d2. |

Nolora receives the PC advantage, so her player rolls 4d2 (drop lowest): 1, 2, 2, 1; plus 3d2 (drop lowest): 1, 2, 1. This equals Wealth 8, giving her a meagre lifestyle (see table on next page). She's adequately fed and wears aged but sturdy clothing. Nolora lives in one of the lodges of her people, not unlike a fair-sized cottage.

Possessions : with a Wealth of 8, Nolora has 800d for gear. Nolora's player selects a fine knife (12d, +1 WQ-see page 88 Masterwork Successes table); a high-quality short sword (192d, +1 WQ); a stout 125-pull long bow (126d, +1 WQ-page 71); and a dozen arrows (15d). She combines heavy clothing under a quilted surcoat (478d), leaving her slightly encumbered but well protected against the elements.

Coins : her possessions come to 823d, so Nolora makes up the 23d overage from the 80d in coins. This leaves 57d, which are saved to spend on exigencies in the initial scenario.

Wealth :	the	score	resulting	from	the	sum	of	Family	Wealth	Dice	and Occupation	Wealth	Dice.	At	character	generation,	Wealth	translates into	possessions	and	coins	(page	51).	Once	the	game	begins, characters	freely	maintain	the	Lifestyle	(below)	associated	with	their score.	Furthermore,	each	month,	they	acquire	an	additional	number of	silver	pennies	based	upon	the	roll	of	a	number	of	the	occupation's Wealth	Dice	(see	Income,	page	414).	Should	characters	gain,	and maintain	for	at	least	one	year,	a	different	steady	occupation,	they generate	a	new	Lifestyle	derived	from	the	roll	of	four	Wealth	Dice associated	with	the	new	occupation	(GMs	may	modify	the	number	of WD	rolled	to	reflect	special	circumstances	and	character	skill).

Social Examples :	the	folk	who	typically	attain	the	given	Wealth. Note	that	wealth	is	distinct	from	status,	so	that	certain	people	of	high position	still	retain	much	of	their	social	advantage	over	their	'lessers' even	if	they	are	poorer	than	most	of	their	own	class.

Lifestyle :	the	general	description	of	the	character's	day-to-day lifestyle,	further	broken	down	into	three	sub-parts-housing,	food, and	clothing.

<!-- image -->

Housing Structure :	the	kind	and	quality	of	home	resided	in.	See Chapter 4: Possessions for	more	details	(page	124).

Food :	the	quality	and	quantity	of	nourishment	attained	on	a	regular basis.

Clothing :	the	material	and	quality	of	clothing	worn.	The	urban poor	wear	sturdy	buckram;	more	expensive	materials	include	soft leather,	linen,	and	silk.	See Chapter 4: Possessions for how to adjust clothing	prices	to	reflect	a	character's	Wealth	score	(page	118).

Lodging : the cost in silver pennies (d) to obtain the equivalent housing	and	food	while	staying	at	an	inn.

Quality :	the	rating	between	one	and	five	stars	of	an	inn.	Characters may	choose	lodging	up	to	two	stars	lower	than	a	given	inn's	Quality but	not	higher.	If	prices	at	an	inn	are	considered low ,	reduce	the	cost by	one	row	for	the	same	quality	of	lodging;	if	prices	are high ,	increase cost	by	one	row;	if	they	are very high ,	increase	cost	by	two	rows.	Some very high five-star	inns	might	offer	Lavish	lodging	(20d-35d	per	day).

## standing example

Melrina is a Popular Young PC from a noble gentry family who practices the guilded occupation of Herald. The Family Wealth Dice amount to 4d6.

| • Parent Estrangement:                | Popular 4 dice                        |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| • Parent Occupation: Noble (Gentry)   | d6                                    |
| The Occupation Wealth Dice equal 1d3. | The Occupation Wealth Dice equal 1d3. |
| • Age Group:                          | Young 1 die                           |
| • Character Occupation: Herald        | d3                                    |

One extra die is rolled for the PC in each group, with the lowest results dropped. The Family 5d6 rolls are 6, 4, 1, 5, 3 (18). The Occupation 2d3 are 1, 3 (3). The sum of the two equals Wealth 21 (18 + 3), an affluent lifestyle. She has risen through occupational success to a level of wealth higher than even her own family's.

In addition to living in an exclusive town house with abundant food and striking clothing, Melrina begins the campaign with 210d in coins and has acquired other possessions worth 2100d.
