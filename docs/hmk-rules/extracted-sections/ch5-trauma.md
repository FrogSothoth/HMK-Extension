# Trauma

## trauma

In addition to social interactions, travel, and combat, characters will likely face physical and mental trauma during their adventures. Most physical trauma affects the body, and most mental trauma, the mind. Some instances can damage both.

## Physical Trauma

Perhaps the more common of the two types, physical trauma is divided into three categories:

Fatigue : an overall lack of energy that can result from arduous travel, lengthy battles, and spellcasting. Such exhaustion accumulates as fatigue, a penalty applied to almost all tests. It usually subsides with rest and sleep, but weakness fatigue can last throughout lingering ailments.

Injury : direct and more life-threatening damage to the body. Injuries manifest as specific states and effects, including bleeding, shock, and impairment.

## Mental Trauma

Often as debilitating as bodily damage, mental trauma manifests in three ways:

Fear : a reaction to perceived danger, most commonly arising from the threat of violence. Characters rely on will, reasoning, and experience to withstand fear, whether responding to the stress of combat or resisting intimidation. Fear usually comes and goes quickly.

Certain strange sources of fear affect folk more intensely. Characters might face such aberrance from ghosts or bizarre beasts.

Stress : a longer-lasting response to severe trauma. The mental equivalent of physical injury, such stress can leave a character's psyche altered, sometimes permanently. The most frightening type of stress-the dreaded Shadow of Bukrai-can even rend a character's soul.

Ailments : physical trauma other than fatigue and injury. This includes disease, malnutrition, poison, and conditions such as heat exhaustion and cold exposure.

Aural Shock : the temporary disruption of the character's connection to the spirit world. While not permanent, Aural Shock prevents Esoteric Group skill and Aura tests.

## injury

1 Skull (sk ) :	Eldir	just	suffered	an S2 e skull	injury.	The	player	notes	the	10 Impairment	in	the	Head	Zone	box,	whose thick	border	implies	that	all	actions	and movement	are	penalised	(page	170).

2 Shoulder (sh ) :	Eldir	suffered	a	G4 e left	shoulder	injury	earlier	in	the	fight	and overcame	the	Shock	State	and	Morale	test. Grievous	injuries	make	the	corresponding zone	unusable	(page	170),	noted	by	the X-mark	in	the	Left	Arm	zone	box.	The injury	was	also	a	Bleeder	(BLD)	because of	the	grey	circle	next	to	the	SHK 3	in	the second	column	(step	3.3,	page	168).

3 Forearm (fo ) : the Healing Rate next to the M1 b implies	that	Eldir	suffered and	received	treatment	for	this	injury before	the	current	fight.	Because	the Treatment	Roll	produced	HR6,	there	is	no Impairment	penalty	in	the	Right	Arm	zone (page	182)-notice	its	empty	white	box. The	injury	is	still	recorded	in	order	to	track Compound	Injury	(step	3.1,	page	168).

## shock

4 Shock State Index : the S2 e skull	injury inflicted	SHK 7	and	the	ensuing	Shock	Roll success	(S)	did	not	change	it	(page	169).

5 State :	the	SHK 7	from	the	skull	injury leaves	Eldir	Stunned	(STN);	its	Serious	injury severity	immediately	triggers	a	Morale	Roll (page	162).	At	the	end	of	his	next	turn	Eldir makes	a	Shock	test	to	recover	(page	169).

6 Bleeding :	while	Eldir	suffered	a	Bleeder from the G4 e shoulder	injury	earlier	in	the current	fight,	bloodloss	is	not	accounted until	five	minutes	after	the	causal	trauma. The	white	boxes	will	then	be	used	to	mark off	accumulated	Blood	Loss	Points	(BP)	from Blood	Loss	Advance	Rolls	(page	178).

## stress

7 Psyche : Eldir acquired the Nervous psyche	trait	and	two	PSY	level	in	a	previous encounter.	The	player	has	also	noted	that the	duration	is	still	Indefinite,	leaving	the chance that the trait will be removed during Psyche	Stress	Recovery	(page	189).
