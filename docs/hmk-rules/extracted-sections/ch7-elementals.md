# Elementals

## Elementals

Perhaps the most ancient of all entities, elementals are spirits of the six elemental principles: Earth, Metal, Fire, Air, Aura, and Water. Each comes from an astral plane of pure energy-a Beleras originates on a primal plane of fire, for instance. While not naturally interested in the affairs of mortal folk, elementals bind to their respective energy in the physical world for two reasons.

Volition : many elementals bind out of their own free will. Some are instinctively drawn to ethereal zones in the physical world, such as the lællyn of Emelrene.

Coercion : some elementals are summoned by mages who attempt to bind them to energy and temporarily control them. Elementals that successfully resist this control either return to their primal plane or remain bound to the energy but free to do as they please.

Elementals in the physical world do not have a body. Instead they take a bound form.

## Bound Form

The physical world substance that receives an elemental's presence is called the bound form . A fire elemental binds to real fire; a water elemental binds to actual water. The more powerful the elemental, the greater the amount of substance required to enable the binding.

Minor Elemental : the weakest elementals bind to a small amount of substance.

Substantial Elemental : the next strongest elementals require a medium amount to bind to.

Great Elemental : an even more powerful elemental must bind to a large amount.

The absolute amount varies between the elemental typesOrivrin need less metal than Sheor do of water. Whatever the amount, elementals can morph these volumes into any shape they wish, even unnatural ones.

## Host Mass

Elementals may exist within a volume much bigger than their bound form-this amount is called the host mass . Thus, a minor water elemental binds to a form about the size of a 5-foot cube. Even if currently 'swimming' in a huge river host mass, its bound form still manifests as a 5-foot cubic volume within this larger area.

Over a long time, an elemental's bound form can grow to reach the size of its host mass, its power increasing concomitantly. In the case of air and water elementals this can be immense. However, these rules describe bound forms that folk have the greatest chance to encounter.

Aura elementals do not have corporeal bound forms or host masses in the physical world-Aura is incorporeal.

## Elemental Abilities

An elemental has a power that correspond to the amount of its bound form-minor, substantial, or great (see page 359 sidebar). The various scores are the same for all six energy types unless stated otherwise in their specific entries.

As spirits, elementals do not have physical attributes and-although sentient-have no Empathy in terms mortals can fathom. However, they do possess Arcane Talents that enable them to interact with and manipulate the substance to which they are bound.

The entries on pages 360-362 detail all the talents each elemental has, such as an Orivax's Molten Surface or an Ivrihn's Pummel . An elemental may attempt to use a talent by making a Talent test (which takes 1 turn unless otherwise noted). The resulting success levels are interpreted just like other arcane talent invocations (page 259). As natural spirits, elementals do not accrue fatigue, but they can suffer Aural Shock.

a

## proximate sensitivity

Elementals have a talent called Proximate Sensitivity. It gives them a chance to perceive when an entity comes within Aura × 20 feet of its bound form. At that point, the elemental makes a Talent test. If successful, it notices the intruder and then makes an immediate Initiative test to measure its response (see Initiative Test table in the page 359 sidebar).

An elemental automatically perceives when its bound form has been directly touched or disturbed. It then becomes active , as described in the same table.

Example : a minor water elemental is bound to a larger pond host mass. A hunter approaches the water's edge, within 40 feet of the Sheor. A roll of 16 against its Proximate Sensitivity Talent ML48 succeeds, alerting it. An Initiative ML25 test is made-a 68 roll means Failure, giving it a passive response. While aware of the entity at the shore, the elemental will not use any of its talents unless the hunter directly disturbs its bound form (the 5-foot cube of water within the larger pond).

## Affecting Elementals

Elementals do not suffer physical trauma. However, they are vulnerable to (1) the disruption of their binding ; and (2) the dissolution of their soul .

## disrupting the binding

An elemental's binding can be disrupted by infusing it with diametric or tertiary energy. These are the same terms used to describe the Pvaric Wheel, replicated in the diagram on page 358. For example, the binding between a Sheor and its water can be disrupted by fire (diametric) and by air and metal (tertiaries). The attack could be a spell that creates the disrupting energy, or an object or a natural quantity of the substance.

Whatever the source, a successful attack forces the elemental to test Spirit . Several factors modify this roll: the volume of the attack; whether the attacking energy is ethereal (such as magic); whether it is tertiary energy. Failure can result in a temporary stress to the binding, or even its complete rupture, which dissolves the elemental for d6 days. See the Spirit Binding table and the accompanying modifiers in the sidebar.

Attack Amount : an attacking energy or substance is rated on the same power scale as elementals: minor, substantial, and great. A fourth level called trace is included as a possible attack amount. This table describes the specific dimensions of these amounts and lists viable examples:

## elemental substances

| amount      | earth                | metal            | fire                 | air      | aura                | water             |

## dissolving the soul

The soul of an elemental originates in its primal plane of energy, passes through the spirit world, and then appears in the physical world, bound to its substance. In the spirit world, the elemental's soul manifests as a vibrant column of colour, according to its elemental type, that streaks away to infinity 'above' to its primal plane.

While bound to substance in the physical world, an elemental's soul in the spirit world is dormant. Its soul is vulnerable to Aural Shock, such as from Aural Blast or Aural Bolt. An active soul in the spirit world could also dissolve the elemental's soul in Spirit Conflict (page 296).

## Elemental Movement

An elemental has a Move score within its host mass equal to Creativity × 5. As a free action, an elemental may reshape its bound form to any dimension that retains the same volume as the base amount.

If an elemental's bound form amount equals its host mass, then the only way of moving is to 'jump' to another host mass that has at least the amount of its bound form. If such a host mass is within a distance in feet equal to the elemental's Move, then it tests Spirit on the Elemental Transfer table (sidebar). Thus, a minor elemental with CRE 7 (Move 35) could attempt such a transfer to a new host mass up to 35 feet away.

## elemental transfer

As part of a Charge or Move action, an elemental may test Spirit to transfer its bound form from its current host mass to another one at least equal in volume and within a full Move's distance:

## àhvisían Air Elemental

min 10' cube sub 20'cube grt 30' cube Ahvisi are one of the most prevalent elementals on Kethira. Many are hidden among the clouds thousands of feet above the ground. Their boundaries are amorphous and difficult to discern, even when close to earth. Sometimes a lesser Ahvisian can be spotted as a haze within its host air mass. All of them seek to manipulate light and wind, and the larger can generate great storms and grow to immense sizes.

Dust Devil : the Ahvisian roils the air along the ground, penalising actions and any LOS passing through or within it according to the ground cover: leaves (-20), dirt (-40), sand or snow (-60). The effect extends beyond its configuration to a distance equal to its base shape (CS ×2). Duration: Talent Index minutes.

Light : the Ahvisi exudes a brief flash of intense light. Anyone looking directly at it within a distance equal to its base shape × 5 must test Perception or become blinded (HP d6 rounds [PER CF 2d6 rounds] · HR5).

## béleras Fire Elemental

min 2'd × 1' h sub 4'd × 2'h grt 6'd × 3'h Perhaps the most volatile and deadly elemental, Belerhin fortunately remain as rare on Kethira as the seed fire they usually need for binding. If interfered with, they exude thick, asphyxiating smoke and lash out to inflict severe burns. A free-willed Beleras, called a Salamander , can remain bound for a time to the heated cinders left after the fuel of its host mass has burned off.

Combust : the Beleras ignites a single source of easily combustible fuel within Talent Index × 5 feet. The amount ignited is one size smaller than itself (thus, a minor Beleras can ignite a trace amount, equal to the size of a burning torch). The new fire burns and spreads naturally. A Beleras can try to transfer to it if the new fire is big enough (page 359 sidebar).

Easily combustible fuel mostly implies dry plants large enough to provide enough fuel-trees, bushes, wooden houses. The elemental cannot combust anything too wet or too small, such as rain-drenched trees, a patch of grass, or a person's clothing.

Void : the elemental quickly reduces the oxygen in the surrounding air. The effect extends beyond its configuration to a distance equal to its base shape (CS ×2). Those within the area gasp desperately for air and must test Endurance at the start of their next turn. The result indicates their indefinite Shock State while within the Void:

Duration: Talent Index rounds.

Wind (Time varies): the Ahvisian manipulates the Windforce (WF) around it (see page 64, Agriculture entry). The effect reaches out to a distance equal to its base shape × 10. The elemental can also choose the wind's direction, thus either decreasing or increasing the natural wind force vector accordingly.

As a 1-turn action, the Ahvisian can create up to half Talent Index in Wind Force for Talent Index rounds.

As a 10-minute action, the Ahvisian can create up to half Talent Index in Wind Force for Talent Index hours.

Engulf : the elemental lashes out, usually elongating its base shape to reach foes. The characteristics of the attack vary according to bound form (see sidebar).

Quiescence : a free-willed Beleras whose host mass has naturally burnt out can remain bound to the still-hot cinders for a number of 4-hour watches equal to its Spirit Index. While in such quiescence, the Beleras can make Combust talent tests with -20 penalty. Any creature touching the bound form of a quiescent Belerasnow invisible-must successfully test Spirit or suffer Aural Shock equal to half the Aura of the Beleras (Spirit CF +1 Aural Shock).

## base shape

An elemental's base shape is the dimension given according to its bound form. Some talent effects are quantified in terms of the base shape, regardless of its actual configuration. For instance, a minor Ahvisian has a 10-foot cube base shape (1000 cubic feet). If configured into a 5' × 5' × 40' stream of air, its Void talent affects those within 10 feet (base shape) of these dimensions-a 25' × 25' × 60' area.

Smoke : the Beleras can belch forth a mass of thick smoke, in addition to what may naturally occur from the burning host mass. The effect extends beyond its configuration to a distance equal to its base shape (CS ×2). All LOS from within or passing through the area is blocked. Anyone within the smoke faces asphyxia (page 183).

Duration: Talent Index minutes.

min 5' cube sub 10' cube grt 15' cube Of all the elementals, the Ivrihn take the most interest in the affairs of folk. Given both the ubiquity of their host mass-the earth-and their proximity to cultivated lands, it is no surprise that Ivrihn often come into contact with people. Aside from burrowing through the ground and crushing rocks, especially aggressive Ivrihn sometimes assume a squat, vaguely humanoid shape to drive off interlopers with pummelling blows.

Burrow : when an Ivrihn moves along the earth's surface, it leaves in its wake rippled ground the width and height of which equals its base shape (CS ×2). Anyone in its path must make an opposed Press Roll against a STR equal to four times the elemental's AUR (thus, minor 8; substantial 24; great 40).

- If moving beneath the surface at a depth equal to up to twice its base shape, then the effective STR is only twice its AUR (minor 4; substantial 12; great 20).
- Deeper passes beyond twice its bound form below ground will only be noticed as a rumble or perhaps slight shaking.

## ôrivax Metal Elemental

min 2" sphere sub 8" sphere grt 10" sphere Since they require rare seed material, Orivrin are perhaps the most exotic elementals encountered on Kethira. They often express affinity for one type of metal, such as gold, silver, or brass. No matter the host, their globular sizes are small, but heavy. They like to bind to arcane artefacts, whose powers they greatly enhance. However, touching an Orivax can prove quite deadly.

Infuse Artefact : Orivax can bind to at least a partly metal minor or EGO-volition major arcane artefact, either on its own or when coerced by the Assemble spell. However bound, the Orivax receives by size an Infusion Pool of 4, 8, or 12 to spend on Infusion Feats (page 220).

Liquify : an Orivax can move its globular mass through other metals and, at half the rate, through fire and over the ground. It avoids water and entities with an Aura. The prospect of directly touching a living entity brings about an aggressive reaction in proportion to the entity's Aura score-the higher the Aura, the more violent the reaction.

ELEMENTALS

Crush stone (1 minute): while freely able to pass through solid rock and stone, an Ivrihn as a 1-minute action may test Talent to pulverise a volume of it equal to its base shape. However, such destruction of its own host mass greatly stresses its own binding. Each Crush Stone test requires the Ivrihn to test Spirit on the Spirit Binding table, page 359 sidebar), perhaps leaving it debilitated or ruptured .

Pummel : the elemental assumes a squat, cylindrical shape with stubby, club-like arms. As an action it may test Talent to make melee strikes. See sidebar for combat characteristics.

Quicksand : the Ivrihn turns ground equal to its base shape into quicksand. While they will not drown, creatures mired in it may take a Move action to test Climbing :

<!-- image -->

When the earned points ( pt ) equal the Ivrihn's base size in feet (5/10/15), the mired creature has climbed free. At end of duration, the ground hardens again… Duration: Talent Index minutes.

Molten Surface (Time varies): a metal elemental threatened by the interaction with Aura responds by producing a greatly heated Molten Surface. An Orivax with a Passive Initiative state must successfully test Talent as a 1-turn action to manifest the effect. With a Defensive or Active state, it may even attempt the test reactively, as a defence option. The intruding creature suffers the burn impact in the location with which it touches the elemental, usually the hand (see Molten Surface table). Once created, the effect lasts one round.

Toxic Gas : as its preferred proximate attack when agitated, the Orivax tests Talent as a 1-turn action to exude a colourless toxic gas (CS also odourless). The gas affects an area around it in a radius according to its bound form (see Toxic Gas table). Creatures within the area suffer toxic poisoning with an onset of one round and a period of one minute (page 186). The virulence varies according to the Orivax's power (CS lower the given HR by 1).

The cloud immediately disperses at the end of the elemental's turn. Since Air is a tertiary element, only a sudden burst like this prevents a stress on the binding to the Orivax's host metal.

## sâvirìs Aura Elemental Duration: Talent Index minutes.

The Aura attribute is not the soul itself but rather the strength of soul. While it remains unknown exactly how souls are created, some believe that not even the gods can do it. At the very least, it seems that the Aura souls possess likely comes from its own elemental plane.

When this primal plane's nativescalled Savrhin-visit the physical world, they bind themselves to a host Aura belonging to a living plant, beast, or person. This Aural binding is not possession, a fact that distinguishes Savrhin from natural spirits such as demons. Exactly why it takes place is unknown, but some speculate that a Saviris' binding is simply the Aura of a future soul exploring what it might be like to inhabit a living body.

Savrhin have Attributes and Skill MLs different from other elementals (sidebar).

Aural Shock : a Saviris may target its host Aura or any other entity's Aura within Talent Index × 10 feet. If the elemental's Talent test succeeds, the entity suffers Aural Shock 2 (CS 4). A successful Spirit test by the target reduces the Aural Shock by 1 (Spirit CS by 2).

## shéôr Water Elemental

min 5' cube sub 10' cube grt 15' cube Given the preponderance of water on Kethira, Sheori are one of the more common elementals. Free-willed water elementals are called Undines , and they can lay dormant for long periods and grow to gargantuan sizes. Though bound to water, Sheori also have arcane talents that create darkness and mute sounds.

Darkness : the Sheor surrounds itself with ethereal darkness. The effect extends beyond its configuration to a distance equal to its base shape (CS ×2). In poor illumination the result is complete darkness. In full light, the effect takes on a deep shadowy gloom, giving other creatures within it +40 bonus to Stealth and -40 penalty to Awareness. Duration: Talent Index minutes.

Silence : the Sheor completely mutes all sound around it. The effect extends beyond its configuration to a distance equal to twice its base shape (CS ×4). Sound neither escapes nor penetrates the silence.

Duration: Talent Index minutes.

Dream Binding: free-willed Savrhin sometimes enter the Lucid Dreams of beings (page 292). When a Lucid Dream occurs, roll a d20. If less than or equal to the dream's resulting duration, then a Saviris has bound to the sleeper's Aura.

The power of the Saviris is determined by the very same d20-roll: 1-4 ( minor ); 5-7 ( substantial ); 8+ ( great ). Upon awakening, the dreamer receives +5 bonus per power level of the Savrhin to Fate Rolls and Aura tests (+5/+10/+15). The bonus decreases by 5 every 3d6 days thereafter. When it reaches 0, the Saviris unbinds itself and leaves. The bonus applies strictly to Fate Rolls and Aura attribute tests, not to skills with Aura in the Skill Base.

Before waking from the Lucid Dream, the dreamer may take Spirit Communion actions with the Saviris to gain further wisdom (see Wellspring, below).

Wellspring : a Lucid Dreamer may attempt Spirit Communing (page 295) with the Saviris. The elemental has an Accepted estrangement, but the experience can unsettle the dreamer. Add the results of the sidebar table to the regular Spirit Communing table.

Stasis : the Sheor reduces all motion around it. The effect extends beyond its configuration to a distance equal to its base shape (CS ×2). Creatures within the Stasis suffer -20 penalty to Move and to AGL and DEX tests (including skills with one of them in its SB), and their weapon impacts are reduced by 4. Projectiles entering or passing through the affected area suffer the same two effects. Duration: Talent Index minutes.

Turbulence : the Sheor creates turbulent waves that batter anyone within a distance from it equal to its base shape (CS ×2). Creatures in the area must make a Press Roll against a STR equal to the Sheor's AUR × 5 (thus, 10/30/50). Duration: one round.
