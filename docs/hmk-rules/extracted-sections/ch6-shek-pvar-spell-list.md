# Shèk-Pvâr Spell List

## spell list

The	spell	entries	in	this	chapter	are	grouped	into	their	respective	Convocations,	which	themselves	appear	in	order	of	their	Tuzyn	seasonal sequence:	Fyvria	is	listed	first	(spring/start	of	year)	and	Odivshe	is	listed	last	(winter/end	of	year).	Neutral	spell	entries	are	gathered	together at	the	end	of	the	chapter.	The	spell	entries	within	each	Convocation	are	then	organised	alphabetically.	As	an	additional	reference	tool,	the following Spell List table	groups	the	Convocational	spells	by	their	increasing	Complexity	Level	(CL),	alphabetically	within	each	CL.

## name

The	spell's	general	name.	Casters	often personalise it to include their given name	(' Obedience of Lineus '),	as	each mage's	Form	is	subtly	different.

## special notes

Some spells include italicised notes:

Artefact spells	come	in	three	subtypes: Enchantment,	Foundation,	and	Volition.

Psychic Bond :	any	Shock	State	the	target suffers	while	under	the	spell's	effect	is also	inflicted	on	the	caster.

Talent bonus : a caster possessing the listed Arcane Talent adds its Index to the corresponding	Spell	Mastery	Level	(ML).

True Sight : the spell lets the caster sense the	target's	True	Form	(page	209).

Neutral spells also list their general category: Artefact , Defence , Dimension , Identity ,	or Incantation .

## time

How long the caster must maintain concentration	to	cast	the	spell,	from spellstart	to	spellfire.

- A Free action Time means spellstart and spellfire	occur	first	on	the	same	IR	of the	round	as	the	1-turn	casting	action.
- A	Time	of	a	day	or	longer	requires	the mage	spend	10	hours	each	day	casting. During	this	time,	the	caster	may	only break	concentration	to	eat	and	sleep.

## range

The maximum distance between the caster	and	the	target	point	of	the	spell. The caster designates the point during spell Declaration and	may	choose	a distance	less	than	the	maximum.

- LOS means the point must also be in the	caster's	unobstructed	line	of	sight.

## target

Where	the	caster	directs	the	spell.	For	more about	many	of	the	following	terms,	see	the Keléstia Glossary (page	430).

Self :	the	caster.	When	a	Bonus	Effect	allows a	spell	normally	cast	on	Self	to	be	cast	on another,	the	subject's	characteristics	are used	for	any	required	tests	or	rolls.	Unless stated	otherwise,	mages	are	immune	to	the negative	spell	effects	of	their	own	castings.

Being :	a	living	entity	with	a	soul	and	a	body (person,	beast,	plant,	WIL-volition	artefact). Some	spells	require	the	incanter	first	to perceive	a	target's	True	Form	(page	209).

obedience · iv

Talent bonus: Enthral Psychic Bond

The caster forces a creature to obey. The target resists the spell with an opposed Spirit test (CS -20 penalty) that beats the casting success level (break ties).

If successful, the mage may spend 1 round concentrating at any time to issue as a free action a single telepathic command to the target still within range and LOS. No common language is needed, but orders that are not instinctual might require beasts to test Creativity to understand (although the mage may attempt such failed commands anew). Targets then act on their own IR. Each command lasts 1 round, so the mage must keep concentrating for longer obedience.

The caster has a Psychic Bond with the target throughout duration (page 237).

7

The spell may target a spirit or astral within range the caster is aware of.

8 The caster may require the target to test Reasoning at the duration's end. If the REA success level is lower than the spell's (break ties), the subject will not recall being affected by spell.

9 Caster may require subject to test Spirit at the duration's end. Failure allows the caster to impart a single action the target must undertake within SI hours (CF within SI days). The psychic bond remains until the end of this period.

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

Duration:

SI × 5 feet in LOS

SI minutes

Creature :	a	person	or	beast,	but	not	plant.

Person :	a	being	with	Morality.

Spirit :	a	living	entity	with	a	soul	but	no body.	Spells	can	also	affect	incarnated spirits	like	they	would	a	being's	body.

Object :	a	non-living	entity	with	a	'body' (shape)	but	no	soul,	such	as	a	chair,	corpse, or	EGO-volition	artefact.	The	relative convocational	similarity	between	the	spell and	the	target	object	might	affect	the Casting	Roll	(see	Object	Element	modifier, page	201).	Certain	spells	limit	the	weight of	target	objects	(if	so,	the	entry	will	clearly state	it).	Artefacts	(pages	256-257)	must weigh	less	than	half	the	mage's	Spirit	ML.

Point :	a	precise	point	in	physical	space.

## complexity level

A	Roman	numeral	from	one	(I)	to	six	(VI). The	higher	the	Complexity	Level	(CL),	the more powerful the spell is and the more difficult	it	is	to	learn	and	cast.

## description

A guide to what happens when the spell is	successfully	cast.	Effects	resulting from	a	Critical	Success	(CS)-beyond the default result in the Casting Roll table (page 202)-are explained in the	description.	In	this	example,	a	CS Obedience	induces	a	-20	penalty	to	the target's	Spirit	test	resistance,	as	noted	in the	first	paragraph.

## bonus effects

Upon attaining each circled Spell Index (SI)	7,	8,	or	9,	the	caster	gains	the corresponding	Bonus	Effect.	Modifiers associated	with	higher	Bonus	Effects replace similar	ones	of	lower	Bonus	Effects (unless noted otherwise).

Note :	Neutral	spells	have	no	Bonus	Effects.

## duration

How	long	the	spell	lasts.

Instantaneous

:	momentary	effect.

Temporary : for a given time length (unless	otherwise	expressly	noted,	a	CS triples the given duration); spell also ends	when	dispelled	or	cancelled.

Indefinite :	until	dispelled	or	cancelled.

Permanent :	forever,	unless	cancelled.

Some enchantments have a Continuous artefact	effect duration	(page	256).

## concentration

From	spellstart	to	spellfire,	mages must be in concentration (page	182). Maintaining it requires them to Ignore attacks	during	the	casting	Time.	If	aware of	being	attacked,	casters	may	defend normally	if	they	Abort	the	spell	as	a	nonaction	(see	step	1.2	on	page	200)	.

Some	spells	even	require	the	mage's concentration	beyond	spellfire	in order	to	maintain	its	effect	throughout duration.	If	concentration	is	broken	or dropped,	the	spell	effect	ends.

Mages cast the Neutral spells Counter , Distort ,	and Reverse on	the	target's Initiative	Rank.	No	matter	the	result, casters of these three spells must Pass on their	next	turn	as	a	special	recovery.

## the forces of f´yvria

The core principle of Fyvrian magic is earth-between the firm crust of Jmorvi metal and the life-sustaining properties of Odivshe water. Fyvrian mages often express both an exuberance for the world's potential as well as a melancholy for its ultimate passing.

## Arcane Recovery

Fyvria spells, the Healing arcane talent (page 262), and the Healing alchemical elixir (page 272) can help recovery from physical trauma by way of a test bonus, or a free Advance, Course, or Healing roll (sidebar).

Test Bonus : the same trauma receives only the single highest test bonus from an arcane source. Thus, an injury that receives +10 bonus from a spell (arcane), +20 bonus from the Healing talent (arcane), and +5 bonus from an herb (mundane) gets a +25 bonus (+20 talent plus +5 herb).

Free Roll : failures (F or CF) from an arcane free roll have no effect-only successes apply. Also, rolls from different arcane sources for the same trauma do not stack. Thus, one free Healing Roll from the spell Balm and the first Healing Roll from an elixir result in just one roll.

## Understanding

Before casting the spells Balm, Nurture, Stay, Succour, and Transfer, the mage must first have an understanding of the target's physical trauma. This can be acquired in three ways:

- [1]  The nature of the trauma is self-evident, with a bruise, compound fracture, bleeding wound, cut, or puncture. If it is not obvious, a successful Physician test grants understanding (one attempt only).
- [2]  The mage successfully casts the Diagnosis spell.
- [3]  The mage successfully invokes the Healing talent's Diagnose action.

## major f´yvria chantries

<!-- image -->

## elemental objects

Fyvrian elemental objects reflect organic processes-for instance, a wooden staff, a bag of earth, or a garland (growth); or a skull or bone necklace (decay).

## physical trauma rolls

Advance Rolls : blood loss (page 178), exposure (page 185), and malnutrition (page 186).

Course Rolls : extended shock (page 179), coma (page 179), infection (page 181), disease (page 184) and poison/toxins (page 186).

Healing Rolls : injuries (page 181), blood loss (page 181), exposure (page 185), and malnutrition (page 186).

## decomposition

The Animus and Diagnosis spells describe corpses according to their decomposition:

| level     | decomposition                         |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| Minimally | slight skin slippage and hair loss    |
| Slightly  | discolouration (grey/green), bloating |
| Partly    | black, caving,somebonesexposed        |
| Mostly    | advanced decay, most bones exposed    |
| Wholly    | dry bone, skeleton                    |

Embalming (page 69) explains the progress of decomposition and how to extend it.

## convocational effects

Below are ten Fyvria effects as examples for Spontaneous Casting (page 207).

Earth	•	Life	•	Death	•	Growth	•	Decay

- 1 Plants	nearby	briefly	writhe.
- 2 The	earth	underfoot	softens	or	stone slightly	crumbles.
- 3 A feeling of vigour washes over all those close	to	the	caster.
- 4 Everyone	near	the	caster	feels	renewed	in their	current	task.
- 5 Everyone	nearby	yawns	or	feels	slightly fatigued.
- 6 Those near the caster feel a sudden wave of	dread	and	mortality.
- 7 The	caster's	hair	grows	nearly imperceptibly.
- 8 The	caster	briefly	seems	to	grow	in	stature.
- 9 All	plants	nearby	wilt	slightly.
- 10 The	taste	of	nearby	food	seems	slightly spoiled	or	soured.

NANG

## animus · v

The caster makes the corpse of a creature no larger than medium size (page 401) move. Since death severs the connection between soul and body, Animus does not allow the mage to communicate with the dead body's personality. Instead, the spell simply allows the mage to dictate the corpse's physical actions from a distance.

At spellfire, the caster can have the corpse perform an action. The corpse no longer has Skill ML, so actions requiring a test use its once-living STR, DEX, or AGL. Refer to a skill's Primary attribute as a guide to assigning actions (thus, striking with a sword tests DEX).

After spellfire, if the corpse is within SI × 10 feet and LOS, make a d10 roll versus a TN equal to Animus SI (CS +2) at the start of each of the caster's turns. A success lets the mage control the corpse as a free action; a failure requires a 1-turn action. If not controlled or out of range, the corpse falls to the ground.

The corpse's state of decomposition affects its performance in three ways:

| decomp    | pen               | imp               | function          |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Minimally | -10               | -1                | STR-2             |
| Slightly  | -20               | -2                | STR-4             |
| Partially | -30               | -3                | STR-6             |
| Mostly    | -40               | -4                | STR-8             |
| Wholly    | Nocontrol allowed | Nocontrol allowed | Nocontrol allowed |

Pen : penalty to Attribute tests and Move. Imp : the impact modifier to successful strikes by the corpse.

Function : a corpse suffers no Shock but is rendered inoperable in two ways:

- A single Grievous skull or torso injury.
- When total Injury Levels equal or exceed the amount given according to Strength and decomposition.

Each individual limb is made inoperable by a single Grievous injury.

<!-- image -->

- 7 Tests made by the animated corpse receive a bonus equal to Animus SI.
- 8 Spell animates half SI corpses of medium or smaller size, or one corpse of large size. After spellfire, a single Animus SI Secondary Roll determines the action requirement that controls all corpses.
- 9 Tests made by the animated corpse receive a bonus equal to Animus SI × 2.

<!-- image -->

Time:

3 rounds

Range:

Touch

Duration:

SI minutes

Animus example : a mage with Animus ML72 makes a Casting Roll Success (S) while touching a slightly decomposed corpse (original STR15, DEX11, AGL10). At spellfire, the caster controls the corpse to stand and move towards a brigand 10 feet away. Its original AGL and STR gives it Move 55, reduced to 35 from decomposition penalty. It expends 10 feet to stand, then 10 feet moving to engage the brigand. The mage's turn ends.

At the start of the next turn, the mage makes a d10 roll against TN7 roll to see if control is issued as a free action, but it fails. So, the mage expends a 1-turn action to have it take the Attack action to make a Press Attack against the brigand with its DEX ML42 (ML55 - 20 penalty + Bonus Effect 7). If successful, its Press Roll is d6 + 11 (STR15 - 4).

## balm · i

Talent bonus: Healing Understanding required

The caster touches a being and designates one injury to receive an immediate Healing Roll (CS +10 bonus). Until actually treated, untreated injuries have a Healing Rate equal to that of a CF Treatment Roll (page 180). The same trauma may receive one such roll from Balm, and only successes (S or CS) take effect-failed Healing Rolls are ignored. Balm does not stack with similar first rolls from other arcane sources (page 213).

<!-- image -->

- 7 The spell may grant an immediate Healing Roll for blood loss, exposure, or malnutrition (CS +10 bonus).
- 8 The spell may grant an immediate Course Roll to one designated physical trauma (CS +10 bonus).
- 9 Range becomes 10 feet in LOS.

Time:

1 round

Range:

Touch

Duration:

Instantaneous

## balsam · v

The spell improves the caster's recovery power and slows biological ageing. Over the next year, the character's Healing Base increases by 1 (CS 2). There is also a 50% chance the next Ageing Roll (page 414) is skipped (CS automatically skipped). The subject can only be affected by one casting of Balsam at a time; subsequent castings before the end of the current's duration have no effect.

Young characters are only affected by the ageing benefits of Balsam six total times; mature characters, five times; and the old, four. This amounts to fifteen total times in a single lifetime. Even when unaffected by the ageing benefits, the character still receives the HB increase.

<!-- image -->

- 7 With Success (S), the next Ageing Roll is automatically skipped.
- 8 Healing Base increases by 2 (CS 3).
- 9 The spell may be laid on a person the caster touches.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Time:

10 hours

Range:

Self

Duration:

1 year

## beckon · vi

The caster summons a Minor Ivrihn from its primal plane and binds it to at least a five-foot cube host mass, such as earthen ground or rock, within range. With spellfire success, the elemental tests Spirit in opposition to the Casting Roll (do not break ties: ).

## opposed beckon-spirit test

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 1 The Ívrihn remains bound to its host mass as a free elemental (page	358).	If	possible, it tries	to	flee	the	mage,	attacking	if	necessary.
- The	Ívrihn	returns	to	its	primal	plane.
- The	mage	controls	the	Ívrihn	for	duration, then	it	returns	to	its	primal	plane.
- The mage controls the Ívrihn for double the duration,	then	it	returns	to	its	primal	plane.
- 3 The mage controls the Ívrihn for triple the duration.	The	mage	may	then	leave	it	bound to its host mass as a free elemental or allow the	Ívrihn	to	return	to	its	primal	plane.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

These results are in addition to those of the Casting Roll table (page 202).

A mage who successfully controls the Ivrihn may take 1-turn actions starting on the following round to command it to perform any action within its power (page 361). Both the mage's command and the Ivrihn's action take place on the mage's Initiative Rank (IR).

<!-- image -->

- Caster may beckon a Substantial Ivrihn into at least a 10-foot cube host mass.
- 8 The Ivrihn has -10 penalty to the opposed Spirit test.
- 9 Caster may beckon a Great Ivrihn into at
- least a 15-foot cube host mass.

Time:

3 rounds

Range:

SI × 5 feet

Duration:

SI  rounds

## decay · i

The caster chooses one of two versions of Decay at spellfire (casting Time given).

Creature (1 round): Healing Periods for physical trauma are doubled. This effect is itself treated as a disease with HR4 (CS HR2) and a period of five days. Targets resist at spellfire with a higher Spirit test success level than Decay's (break ties).

Plants (10 minutes): once per year, the Land Quality for the next yield of SI acres of vegetation is reduced by 0.1 (CS 0.2).

- 7 Range becomes SI × 100 feet in LOS.
- 8 One extra creature may be affected.
- 9 Plant yield is reduced by 0.2. (CS 0.4).

Time:

1 round

Range:

10 feet

Duration:

Instantaneous

## diagnosis · ii

Talent bonus: Healing

The caster understands all of a creature's physical trauma and gets a +10 bonus (CS +30) to Physician tests to treat them.

- 7 With a shared language, caster may grant the same bonuses to a different character's treatment tests.
- 8 Treatment bonuses increase by +10.
- 9 Spell may instead be cast on a corpse to determine its cause of death.

Time:

1 round

Range:

SI × 10 feet in LOS

Duration:

Instantaneous

## earthwork · iv

The caster touches the ground with a hand, foot, or elemental object and creates an earthen mound of one five-foot cube per SI. The mound must distend from underground. There is no effect if targeted in thin air or on top of solid metal, stone, or wood.

The caster can have the mound extend in any direction from the designated point, but it must be in contiguous fivefoot cubes. The final shape may not be greater than 10 feet high, nor higher than it is wide. The mound forms around metal, stone, and wooden structures or objects, and plants (perhaps burying them), but does lift up creatures standing on it. At the end of duration, the mound collapses flat, back down to the ground.

- 7 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS.
- 8 The mound may be twice as high as it is wide, but not greater than 10 feet high.
- 9 The mound may be up to 15 feet high and merely 5 feet wide.

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

Touch

Duration:

SI  minutes

## growth · i

The spell enhances the natural growth of SI acres of crops. The caster concentrates and walks slowly within range of the targeted plants throughout casting time. Once per year, the spell increases the Land Quality (LQ) of the next yield by 0.1 (CS 0.2). LQ is an index between 0.50 (poor) and 2.00 (excellent) measuring soil fertility and climate (1.00 is average).

- 7 Range becomes SI × 100 feet in LOS, and casting time becomes 5 minutes per acre.
- 8 Effective LQ increases by 0.2 (CS 0.3).
- 9 Effective LQ increases by 0.3 (CS 0.4).

Time:

30 minutes per acre

Range:

10 feet

Duration:

Instantaneous

## guardian · iv

A targeted plant or creature alerts the caster when a living entity intrudes within its natural perceptive range (about 5 feet for plants). To be detected, a spirit must be incarnate (the guardian cannot sense the Spirit World). The caster may instruct the guardian to ignore certain entities, such as innocuous insects.

The caster must be within S I × 50 feet of the guardian to notice the alarm telepathically. The intruder is not identified or described-simply noticed.

- 7 Caster is alerted in general terms as to the intruder's nature ('large humanoid' or 'huge reptile').
- 8 Caster is alerted to the specific nature of the intruder, according to the extent of the guardian's own senses.
- 9 The caster may limit the alarm to a specific entity class (humans, bears, etc.).

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

Touch

Duration:

SI × 10 minutes

## hunger · iii

One creature suffers an immediate onset of starvation with a starting virulence of HR4 (page 186). As the Outcome table indicates on page 184, the victim at once accrues 10 weakness fatigue. With no food, the creature makes an Advance Roll every two days ; with half rations, every four days . The starvation either ends naturally or at the end of Duration. In the last case, the character immediately loses any weakness fatigue or Shock State associated with the starvation.

- 7 All Advance Rolls have -10 penalty.
- 8 Advance Roll periods are reduced to one day (no rations) or two days (half rations).
- 9 Spell affects up to SI creatures.

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

SI × 10 feet in LOS

Duration:

SI days (CS +2 days)

## meld · vi

The caster, and up to half Spirit ML pounds of worn or carried gear, are able to meld through stone, earth, or woodbut not through forged metal, enchanted objects, or living material. Maximum movement with a Move action varies according to the intervening material:

| material   | moveaction           |
|------------|----------------------|
| Stone      | Half Move(Difficult) |
| Wood       | HalfMove             |
| Earth      | FullMove             |

While melding, the caster retains solidity and continues to be subject to physical injuries and effects. If the spell wears off in stone or wood, the caster immediately dies; in earth, the caster begins to suffocate (see Asphyxia, page 183).

- 7 The spell affects up to half SI living creatures as long as they remain in skin contact with the caster after spellfire and move with the same rate restrictions. Each affected creature other than the caster reduces duration by one round.
- 8 Rates of movement for the mage (only) increase by one category-Half (Difficult) to Half; Half to Full; and Full to Double.
- 9 The spell may be laid on a person the caster touches (Duration is SI rounds).

Time:

3 rounds

Range:

Self

Duration:

SI × 2 rounds

NANG

## nurture · iii

Talent bonus: Healing Understanding required

All the Healing Rolls of one designated physical trauma receive +10 bonus for the duration of its recovery (CS +20). The subject falls unconscious for one hour at spellfire. Nurture affects the same trauma only once but applies whether cast before or after mundane treatment. Only the highest similar bonus applies among several arcane sources (page 213).

- 7 A Critical Success (CS) gives a +30 bonus.
- 8 A Success (S) gives a +20 bonus.
- 9 May be cast to stop bleeding from one injury immediately.

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

Self or Touch

Duration:

Instantaneous

## petrification · vi

The caster touches a creature and turns it to stone. An unwilling target tests Spirit and avoids the effect by beating the spellfire Success Level (break ties). Petrified subjects weigh three times their normal weigh, and their bodily functions slow to a negligible, safe level.

- 7 Effect may turn victims to wood, weighing half their normal weight.
- 8 Targets are still petrified SI rounds if their Spirit test merely wins a tie break.
- 9 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS.

Time:

3 rounds

Range:

Duration:

SI minutes (CS SI hours)

## physique · iii

A physical attribute score of the caster or target creature increases by 2 (ML +10). Skills with this attribute in their Skill Base increase ML by 5. Physique does not combine on the same attribute with itself or any attribute-enhancing effect.

- 7 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS.
- 8 Score increases by 4/ML+20 (skill ML +10).
- 9 Score increases by 6/ML+30 (skill ML +15).

Time:

2 rounds

## pox · ii

The caster induces immediate infection in a single injury that already has the potential to be infected (that is, its HR is in a grey box). The infected wound may be treated normally; it may run its course, or it will end if Pox is dispelled.

- 7 Spell works on any injury, regardless of whether they normally become infected.
- 8 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS.
- 9 Spell can cause infection (with HR4) in a location even without an existing injury.

Time:

1 round

Range:

Touch

Duration:

Indefinite

## regenesis · vi

Talent bonus: Healing

The spell slowly reconnects a person's amputated arm. The limb must have been severed within the last SI days, and it must be at least 90% intact. With successful spellfire, the arm attaches and begins to recover as a G5 e injury with Healing Rate  5. There is no chance of infection, but indefinite and permanent impairment are still possible. Follow the steps of the Healing Sequence (page 177) to determine the outcome.

The process is stressful. At spellfire the patient makes an Endurance test (Regenesis CS +20 bonus)

<!-- image -->

The result is the indefinite Shock State the patient suffers until the arm recovers to an S3 e injury.

Creatures may only be under the effect of one Regenesis spell at a time.

- 7 Spell may reconnect a severed leg.
- 8 Spell may reconnect an ear, eye, or nose.
- 9 The spell works even without the severed body part-true regeneration. However, the injury recovers with HR3, and the accompanying END test has -20 penalty (Regenesis CS no penalty).

Time:

1 hour

## shape · i

The caster may direct a single plant to change into a particular configuration, such as a tree into the general shape of a person or-with multiple castingsseveral bushes into a tight hedgerow.

7

- Spell may affect up to half SI plants, but duration is split evenly among them.
- 8 Range is SI × 10 feet in LOS.
- 9 Spellfire CS allows a concentrating caster to modify the shape later at any point throughout duration.

Time:

1 round

Range:

Touch

Duration:

SI × 10 minutes

## slumber · iv

Talent bonus: Healing

The caster touches a creature and renders it unconscious for duration (called deep sleep ). An unwilling subject may resist with a Spirit success level that exceeds Slumber's. On a tie, the creature is instead stunned for SI rounds ( drowsy ), with no usual round-by-round test to overcome.

Someone may rouse a subject in a deep sleep by taking one minute and succeeding on a Physician test with +30 bonus. Otherwise, the creature awakens at the end of duration.

After a deep sleep that lasts the entire duration, a willing target gets a Healing or Course Roll (as applicable) for each physical trauma (CS +10 bonus). All windedness fatigue is removed and weariness is reduced as if the target had just slept 8 hours (page 176).

Each trauma may receive only one such roll from Slumber (Bonus Effect 9 allows two rolls per trauma). Each trauma's rolls do not stack with similar rolls from other arcane sources (page 213). Thus, an injury targeted by Balm (one roll) and Slumber (one roll) receives only one Healing Roll.

- 7 Range becomes SI × 5 feet.

8

- Spellfire Critical Success (CS) gives a +20 bonus to Healing and Course Rolls for all affected traumas.

9

- If Time is 10 minutes, then any success gives a willing target two applicable Healing or Course Rolls per trauma. Duration is 8 hours (S) or 1 hour (CS).

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

Touch

Duration:

1 hour (CS 30 minutes)

## stay · ii

Talent bonus: Healing Understanding required

The caster designates one understood injury of a target creature. Its next Healing Roll that results in CF is treated as a Failure (F). The spell ends when this CF is rolled (CS after two CF) or when the injury heals. The same trauma may benefit from only one Stay spell.

- 7 May be applied to one understood trauma involving any Healing and Advance Roll.
- 8 May be applied to a trauma's Course Roll.
- 9 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS.

Time:

1 round

Range:

Touch

Duration:

Instantaneous

## succour · v

Talent bonus: Healing Understanding required

The caster touches a creature and induces rapid healing in a single injury. The target may not be bleeding, suffering extended shock, or in a coma (page 179). Succour removes all the target's windedness and weariness fatigue that existed prior to the spell. While not instantaneous, the recovery requires no Healing Rolls and carries no risk of infection or impairment. At spellfire the target accrues 10 new weakness fatigue for every Injury Level of the designated injury.

Every 24 hours, make a d10 roll versus a TN equal to Succour SI. A success reduces the target's accrued fatigue by 5 and the Injury Level by 1. Make d10 rolls until both the fatigue and Injury Level are 0. Fatigue accrued during this time does not begin to abate until Succour's fatigue is 0. After duration, the injury heals naturally at its current Severity and Injury Level (if not already fully healed).

Creatures may be under the effect of only one Succour spell at a time.

- 7 Patient accrues only 5 new weakness fatigue per Injury Level.
- 8 At spellfire the patient receives an immediate Succour SR.
- 9 Patient accrues only 5 new weakness fatigue per two full Injury Levels.

Time:

10 minutes

Range:

Touch

Duration:

Half SI days

## syncope · ii

A designated creature within SI × 5 feet and in LOS becomes tired and falls asleep ( light sleep ). An unwilling target may resist the effect with a Spirit success level that exceeds Syncope's. On a tie, the target instead accrues 10 weariness fatigue ( weary ).

Creatures remain in a light sleep for duration, or, if it is their normal sleeping period, through the night. Vigorous shaking for one round also wakes them. However awakened, the creature then becomes weary , accruing 10 weariness fatigue. Creatures retain Syncope's weariness fatigue beyond the spell's duration and recover from it in the usual manner.

- 7 Effect may extend beyond the caster in a SI × 5 foot radius. Half SI creatures closest to the caster are affected.
- 8 At spellfire caster may designate half SI creatures as immune to the effect.
- 9 Subjects who become weary accrue 20 weariness fatigue rather than 10.

Time:

1 round

Range:

SI × 5 feet in LOS

Duration:

Half SI × 5 minutes

## transfer · iii

Understanding required

The caster transfers a known ailment (page 183) in one creature (the subject) to another creature (the target). A creature is a living entity with a body and at least Aura and Will (people and beasts). The caster must touch both creatures throughout casting time. An unwilling target may resist the effect with a Spirit test success level that exceeds Transfer's (break ties). Even with casting success, the target must itself succeed on an Aura test for the transferal to happen (Transfer CS +20 bonus to target's Aura test).

- 7 Transferral may be into or out of any being with a body, which includes plants and Will-volition artefacts.
- 8 Touch still required for subject creature, but target may be up to SI × 5 feet away in LOS.
- 9 With CS, no Aura test required by target.

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

Touch

Duration:

Permanent

## tremor · ii

Talent bonus: Elemental Earth Bolt The caster strikes the ground with a hand, foot, or elemental object, and a mild earth tremor radiates SI × 5 feet out from the point struck. Although it does not affect structures, Tremor forces all moving or standing creatures (except the caster) within the area to make a Stumble Roll at the start of their turn throughout duration (CS -20 penalty). Moreover, all movement is Difficult (page 160).

- 7 Caster may delay the tremor for up to SI rounds after spellfire.
- 8 The effect is more violent. Stumble Roll has a -20 penalty (CS -40 penalty).
- 9 The caster may have Tremor radiate from the point struck in a 5-foot-wide line and chosen direction out to SI × 10 feet.

Time:

1 round

Range:

Self

Duration:

SI rounds

## tunnel · v

The caster can see SI × 5 feet through an expanse of earthen matter such as soil, an earthen floor or mound, or even sand or loose gravel. The base version of the spell does not allow vision through bedrock, metal, or solid stone, or through organic material. Such matter is seen in the Tunnel but blocks vision behind it.

Light outside the Tunnel illuminates at half the strength into it, so the effect is rather like peering into a shadowy room (Perception tests might be required to spot details). The mage cannot move into the Tunnel, nor can it be physically penetrated, for instance with a hand or thrown object. If the Tunnel's extent reaches beyond the earthen material, the mage sees the space beyond in whatever lighting condition illuminates it.

- 7 The Tunnel allows vision through  organic material such as plants and roots. Metal, bedrock, stone walls, and creatures still block vision.
- 8 Caster may hear noises in and beyond the Tunnel, but they are quite muted. None may be sent into or through it by the mage.
- 9 The Tunnel penetrates metal, bedrock, and stone, but creatures still block vision.

The caster renders half SI pounds of organic material edible and nutritious. About three pounds feeds one person for a day. Poisonous or toxic material remains so, even after casting.

- 7 Affects SI pounds of organic material.
- 8 Caster may neutralise poisons and toxins contained in the food.
- 9 By touching the eater after the food is eaten, caster may reactivate neutralised poisons and toxins.

## vine · iv

The caster targets a plant in the ground no more than one foot tall and causes it to enlarge to a volume of 1000 cubic feet of tough, tangled growth (halve volume in very dry conditions). The caster may shape the Vine into any dimensions as long as its new height is not greater than ten times its natural height (a common form is a 5' thick by 5' tall by 40' long wall).

The growth begins at spellfire and full volume is reached after an additional period equal to casting time. This allows aware creatures to step aside of its growth. Once at full volume, the thicket prevents movement. If cast on thorny plants, the Vine inflicts d3 separate d8+1 p strikes on creatures first caught in it or moving into its space (ZD d10).

Felling tests (page 87) against a one-foot wide section may be tried each minute. A hole is cut through if Felling SV exceeds Vine SI × its thickness in feet.

At the end of duration, the plant begins to rot and, after SI minutes, nothing remains but compost and mud.

- 7 Spell may be cast simultaneously on a second plant within five feet of the first.
- 8 Spell may affect potted living plantsdirect ground contact not required.
- 9 As 1-turn actions after spellfire, caster may command a Vine to make one Grab (hold) attack with Reach 5, using Vine ML and a Strength equal to Vine SI × 2 (page 106). Thorny plants inflict their strikes, as above, even if the Grab (hold) fails.

## warp · iii

The caster inflicts half SI points of warpage (CS SI points) on a wooden object. Objects are destroyed when warpage ( wrp ) equals or exceeds the given amount. For example:

| object       |   wrp | object     |   wrp |
|--------------|-------|------------|-------|
| arrow shaft  |     1 | bedframe   |     6 |
| club         |     2 | trunk      |     7 |
| spear        |     3 | door       |     8 |
| roundshield  |     4 | cart       |     9 |
| large shield |     5 | drawbridge |    10 |

At least half the amount of WRP makes the object unusable. At least one fourth WRP levels -10 penalty to its function.

Example 1 : against a spear, 3 or more WRP points break it; 2 points make it unusable; 1 point levels -10 penalty to wield it.

Example 2 : against a door, 8 or more WRP points sunder it; 4-7 make it stuck in its frame or unclosable; 2-3 points require a STR test with -10 penalty to open it.

Example 3 : against a drawbridge, 10 or more WRP points break it; 5-9 make it stuck in its frame or unclosable; 3-4 points make Stumble tests include -10 penalty.

Successful additional castings against the same object only increase WRP by 1, up to a maximum SI warpage (mages cannot improve on an initial CS casting).

- 7 Spell may be cast in reverse, perhaps unwarping a door or reducing an object's current warpage.
- 8 Caster may spread warpage in excess of the target object's WRP to a different object within range. This may be done each time an object's WRP is exceeded.
- 9 Warpage increases by 1 (CS 2).

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

SI × 5 feet in LOS

Duration:

Instantaneous

## wasting · iv

The caster curses the target with a wasting disease. The victim resists the spell with a Spirit test success level that exceeds Wasting's (break ties). If unable to resist, the victim accrues 10 weakness fatigue per victory step of the spell.

Every day throughout duration, the victim tests Spirit :

## target spirit test

- cf Victim	accrues	10	weakness	fatigue	and makes	a	Shock	Roll	versus	SHK 6	(page 169).	Any	resulting	Shock	State	lasts indefinitely	through	duration.
- f Victim	accrues	5	weakness	fatigue.
- s No	additional	effect.
- cs Reduce	duration	by	one		day.

At the end of duration, any indefinite Shock State is lifted and the target receives an immediate END SR, a success of which reduces weakness fatigue by five. Repeat the END SR daily until all of the weakness fatigue is eliminated.

- 7 Wasting inflicts an additional 5 weakness fatigue in the initial opposed Spirit test.
- 8 A CF in the Target Spirit Test table results instead in 15 more weakness fatigue and a Shock Roll against SHK 7.
- 9 If caster has perceived the target's True Form, then LOS is no longer required.

Time:

## the artifice of jmôrvi

The core principle of Jmorvi magic is metal-between the deep-rooted minerals in Fyvrian earth and the heat-forged artifice of Peleahn fire. Jmorvi smith-mages are often focused and resolute, when not lost in an unyielding and stubborn routine. HÁCHERDAD

## Artefact Enchantments

The following Jmorvi spells are artefact enchantments, cast in conjunction with the Artefact Creation Sequences (pages 256-257): Anvil (III), Armour (V), Charm (III), Steel (V), Swordbreaker (IV). If cast while the object is crafted, these enchantments can have a Permanent duration; if obtained beforehand, duration is Indefinite.

## Density Index

Metals are given a Density Index-the higher, the heavier. The Jmorvi spells Aspect (II) and Forge (IV) specifically refer to it:

| metal       |   di | metal   |   di | metal   |   di | metal              |   di |
|-------------|------|---------|------|---------|------|--------------------|------|
| Truesilver  |   10 | Lead    |    5 | Brass   |    4 | Zinc               |    3 |
| Gold        |    9 | Silver  |    5 | Iron    |    3 | Antimony           |    3 |
| Gold coin   |    8 | Copper  |    4 | Steel   |    3 | Arsenic ( grey )   |    2 |
| Quicksilver |    6 | Bronze  |    4 | Tin     |    3 | Arsenic ( yellow ) |    1 |

## major jmôrvi chantries

BELÉKA

CHANTRY QUALITY

## elemental objects

Jmorvi elemental objects reflect a sturdy practicality and are usually mostly metal, for instance a hammer, chisel, file, spike, or ring.

## metallic proportions

Objects handled by a Jmorvi mage are rated by their metallic proportion by weight:

| rating    | min.   | example        |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Minimally | 1%     | hobnailed boot |
| Slightly  | 5%     | belt           |
| Partly    | 20%    | spear, arrow   |
| Mostly    | 50%    | axe            |
| Wholly    | 90%    | sword          |

## convocational effects

Below are ten Jmorvi effects as examples for Spontaneous Casting (page 207).

## Metal	•	Mineral	•	Artifice	•	Substance	•	Toxicity

- 1 Any	metal	items	worn	by	the	caster	briefly shine	or	sparkle,	noticeable	only	to	those directly	viewing	them.
- 2 The	metal	of	items	worn	or	carried	by	a single	person	nearby	soften	slightly	and then	quickly	reharden.
- 3 All	close	by	hear	a	very	faint	ringing,	like the	single	stroke	of	a	distant	hammer	on an	anvil.
- 4 Any	one	mostly	or	wholly	metallic	item held	by	a	person	nearby	briefly	feels	warm.
- 5 The	caster's	visage	suddenly	appears	stern and	unyielding.
- 6 A	flash	of	insight	grants	a	+5	bonus	to	a	test of	one	of	Lockcraft,	Metalcraft,	Mineralogy, and	Weaponcraft	within	the	next	minute.
- 7 Any	metalcrafted	object	held	by	the	caster seems	valuable	or	of	improved	quality	to those	nearby.
- 8 A	known	spirit	in	animation	(page	297)	of a	nearby	object	which	the	mage	touches must	immediately	test	Spirit	or	take	no action	for	one	minute.
- 9 The	eyes	of	everyone	near	the	caster	water from	slight	irritation.
- 10 A slight odious smell washes over those near	the	caster.

## anvil · iii

The mage follows the Artefact Creation Sequence (pages 256-257), enchanting one wholly metallic weapon weighing between 1 and SI pounds as a minor or major artefact. The Anvil enchantment improves weapon impact by 1 (CS 2).

- 7 May be cast on one partly or mostly metallic weapon, like a spear or axe, or on half SI at least partly metallic objects that each weigh less than one pound (such as arrow- or boltheads)
- 8 Spellfire CS improves impact by 3.
- 9 Spellfire S improves impact by 2.

Time:

10 hours

Range:

Duration:

Continuous artefact effect

## armour · v

The mage enchants articles of wholly metallic armour (mail or plate) as minor artefacts, improving each article's Armour Value by 1 (CS 2). Each casting affects a mass of articles ( art ) equal to SI. One casting could affect several small articles, or several castings could all apply to a single larger one.

| article   |   art | article   |   art |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Byrnie    |     7 | Hauberk   |    13 |
| Coudes    |     1 | Helm      |     1 |
| Cowl      |     1 | ¾Helm     |     1 |
| Cuisse    |     3 | Kneecops  |     1 |
| Cuirass   |     5 | Leggings  |     7 |
| Gauntlets |     1 | Mittens   |     1 |
| Greathelm |     2 | Rerebrace |     1 |
| Greaves   |     2 | Spaulders |     1 |
| Habergeon |     9 | Vambraces |     1 |

Each article is its own minor artefact with Armour as its one enchantment. An article requiring multiple Armour castings is still considered one enchantment if such castings are made sequentially during step 3 of the Minor Artefact Creation sequence (page 256)

- 7 May be cast on mostly metallic armour, such as scale.
- 8 Spellfire CS improves av by 3.
- 9 Spellfire S improves av by 2.

Time:

## aspect · ii

The caster uses one ounce of a seed metal to transform the surface of a metal object weighing up to SI pounds into the metal of the seed. The seed metal must have a Density Index equal to or up to half SI higher than the target metal (see table on page 219).

The transformation is extremely thin and fragile, so any inspection by a person who succeeds on an Awareness test reveals the enchantment. For example, scratching with a fingernail might remove the plating. A spellfire CS raises the required perception test to a CS.

- 7 Range becomes SI × 5 feet.
- 8 Seed metal may have a Density Index up to half SI lower than the target metal.
- 9 Seed metal may have a Density Index up to SI lower than the target metal.

Time:

## assemble · vi

The caster summons a Minor Orivax from its primal plane and binds it to a host mass within range at least the size of a 3 lb sword (see Elemental Substances , page 359). With spellfire success, the elemental tests Spirit in opposition to the Casting Roll (do not break ties: ).

## opposed assemble-spirit test

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 1 The Ôrivax remains bound to its host mass as a free elemental (page	358).	If	possible, it tries	to	flee	the	mage,	attacking	if	necessary.
- The	Ôrivax	returns	to	its	primal	plane.
- 1 The	mage	controls	the	Ôrivax	for	duration, then	it	returns	to	its	primal	plane.	While under	control,	the	Ôrivax	is	not	disrupted	or threatened	by	the	mage's	Aura	( page 359 ).
- 2 The mage controls the Ôrivax for double the duration,	then	it	returns	to	its	primal	plane.
- 3 The mage controls the Ôrivax for triple the duration.	The	mage	may	then	leave	it	bound to its host mass as a free elemental or allow it	to	return	to	its	primal	plane.

These results are in addition to those of the Casting Roll table (page 202).

A mage who successfully controls the Orivax may take Free actions starting on the following round to command it to perform any action within its power (page 361). Both the mage's command and the Orivax's action take place on the mage's Initiative Rank (IR).

When commanded to Infuse Artefact (page 361) with its host mass, the Orivax receives an Infusion Pool of 4, 8, or 12 (by size) and, if required, becomes automatically attuned to it. As part of a Free action command, the mage may have the Orivax spend points to express Infusion Feats with the bound artefact:

- Spend 2 points to absorb the cost of one charge expended in a 1-turn artefact invocation by the mage on the same IR.
- Increase duration of an already active latent enchantment. Each point spent increases the enchantment's SI by 1 for calculating duration. This extended duration remains in effect even beyond the duration of the Orivax's binding.
- Increase any of its Jmorvi continuous effects by one 'unit' per point spent: +1 impact (Anvil), +3 AV (Armour), +5 bonus (Charm), +5 Weapon Damage (Steel or Swordbreaker).
- Increase any of its Neutral continuous effects by one 'unit' per point spent: +SI range multiple (Alarm), +2 impact (Bane), +5 points (Fount), +SI bonus (Focus), +5 points (Resurge).

The mage using the same Free action may command the Orivax to expend any number of points from the Infusion pool, or may spread such commands out over the duration of Assemble. In either case, when the duration of Assemble ends, the Orivax is dissolved and all the Infusion feats end (except for the one that extends latent enchantment durations, as mentioned above). An Orivax suffering Aural Shock at any point also terminates the Infusion feats.

In the case of a free willed Orivax, the GM selects the Infusion Feats it performs and expends the points. Once all are spent, the Orivax usually becomes dormant (see Initiative Test table in page 359 sidebar).

- 7 Caster may assemble a Substantial Orivax into a host mass at least the size of a metal brazier (page 359).

8

- The Orivax has -10 penalty to the opposed Spirit test.
- 9 Caster may assemble a Great Orivax into a host mass at least the size of an anvil (page 359).

## charm · iii

The mage follows the Artefact Creation Sequence (page 257) and enchants as a major artefact one wholly metallic weapon weighing between one and SI pounds. The Charm enchantment gives the weapon +5 bonus to applicable tests (CS +10). Charmed weapons may be damaged only by other Charmed weapons with an equal or higher Charm bonus.

Applicable tests include Fumble Rolls, Melee (for hand weapons), Throwing, and Missile tests (for the projectiles and the weapon itself, which stack together).

- 7 May be cast on one partly or mostly metallic weapon, like a spear or axe, or on half SI at least partly metallic objects that each weigh less than one pound (such as arrow- or boltheads)
- 8 Spellfire CS grants +15 bonus.
- 9 Spellfire S grants +10 bonus.

Time:

10 hours

Range:

Touch

Duration:

Continuous artefact effect

## dart · ii

The caster touches a single wholly or mostly metallic object weighing no more than one pound. With successful spellfire, the caster may immediately throw the object by testing Throwing or Dart ML, before fatigue accrual. All the object's characteristics reflect its actual shape and nature, as given in the Throw Weapon and Thrown Objec t tables (page 110). Its impact increases by 2 (CS 4), in addition to the modifiers due to range and Strength, and the Dart is considered an enchanted weapon. The caster may hold it after spellfire-the effect lasts until duration ends or until the object is thrown. Dart may not be combined with any other spell or enchantment.

- 7 May be cast on a partly metallic object weighing no more than SI pounds, such as a javelin or spear.
- 8 Caster may place the effect on half SI objects, each weighing no more than one pound.
- 9 Caster may place the effect on an object so that anyone may throw it. Accuracy is tested by that person's Throwing ML.

Time:

1 round

Range:

Touch

Duration:

SI × 10 minutes

## fist · iv

The spell infuses either one hand or foot (chosen at spellfire) with Metal principle. The effect increases by 6 b the impact dealt in a Punch or Kick (page 106). Length (LNG) and Zone Die (ZD) remain the same, and Impact TA is 3 b . The appendage stiffens to such a state only when it successfully strikes or blocks; otherwise it behaves and looks normal. The subject tests Melee as an armed strike instead of a natural weapon. The Fist is unaffected itself by Weapon Damage (page 191), but receives +5 bonus to damage other weapons.

- 7 Spell can be laid on a person the caster touches.
- 8 The spell can affect both hands or both feet, or one of each (chosen at spellfire).
- 9 Subject may achieve Point Aspect by using fingers (d8 + 3 p + STR modifier).

Time:

## forge · iv

The caster turns one ounce of a wholly metallic object into another metal of equal Density Index or 1 point lighter (page 219). Without a seed sample of the target metal, Forge EML has -20 penalty. A Metalcraft workshop-or Glove spellis also necessary in the process.

With a Forge CS the duration is Permanent and the target becomes mundane metal (not enchanted).

- 7 The target metal can have a density index up to 2 points lighter.
- 8 The target metal can have a density index up to 3 points lighter.
- 9 The target metal can have a density index up to 1 point heavier.

Time:

## foundry · ii

The caster designates Lockcraft, Metalcraft, Mineralogy, or Weaponcraft at spellfire. Foundry increases by 1 SV a single Success Value test to craft an object using the designated skill. The increase lasts until the test is made or the end of duration. If the mage does not undertake the crafting in a workshop, then the spell has no effect.

- 7 Caster can designate Ceramics, Fletching, Masonry, or Woodworking.
- 8 Caster can designate Hideworking, Milling, or Textilecraft.
- 9 Caster can designate Glassworking or Jewelcraft.

## hand · v

The caster manipulates a wholly metallic object-weighing no more than SI pounds and within half SI × 5 feet and LOS-as if it were personally held in one hand. Gestures replicate those that would be necessary to manipulate the object were it held: to lift a door latch, the caster's hand rises; to strike with a sword, the caster's arm swings. Once at spellfire, and then as a free action at the start of each later turn, the caster can move an unattached target object from one point to another anywhere within range.

If using Hand to fight with a weapon, the caster tests the higher of Hand ML or Melee ML as a 1-turn action. The weapon's Heft is ignored and the Impact Modifier is derived from Hand SI × 2 instead of Strength score. The distant weapon does not suffer from outnumbering but does contribute to it against foes (including as an Ally or in Flanking, if those options on page 191 are in use). Mages can Block or Counterstrike attacks made against themselves if the Hand weapon is within five feet of both the mage and the attacker. However, any such failed Counterstrike results in a strike on the mage, not the weapon.

If the object is required to make a Fumble or Stumble Roll, instead reduce duration by one round.

- 7 May be cast on a partly or mostly metallic weapon, like a spear or axe.
- 8 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS.
- 9 Duration becomes SI minutes.

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

Half SI × 5 feet in LOS

Duration:

See page 222 for an example of casting the Hand spell.

NANG

a Hand Example (see page 221): a mage with Hand ML83 targets a shortsword lying on the ground 20 feet away. After two rounds of concentration, the mage takes the 1-turn Incant action to make the Casting Roll. In the middle of a loud melee, the mage has EML reduced to 73. A roll of 22 is a Success (S), causing 15 Fatigue. At spellfire, the caster 'lifts' the sword with a hand gesture and points to another spot in the melee, sending it to engage an enemy that has moved right next to the mage.

The mage only has Melee ML33 so will test Hand ML83 (minus the 15 fatigue from the casting) in combat with the shortsword. It does d10 + 5 e impact, the weapon's base amount plus the 3 Strength bonus derived from twice Spell SI8 ('Strength' 16).

The enemy attempts to strike the mage. With the sword within five feet of both attacker and mage, the mage has the sword Block the strike using EML68 in the opposed Melee test. The next turn, the mage could move the sword 20' (free action) and then attack with it as a 1-turn action.

## lance · vi

Talent bonus: Elemental Metal Bolt The caster calls forth red hot, primal iron into the world, forms it into a javelinshape, and propels it towards a target in LOS. The caster can throw it immediately at spellfire, before accruing casting fatigue, or can throw it on a later turn (but then must account for the casting fatigue). In either case, the mage tests Lance ML or Throwing ML. Follow the rules for Thrown Weapons (page 110) and the Missile Sequence (page 163). The Base Range is SI × 5 feet (but with no Volley range), and the Zone Die is d6 at Direct (PB) and d8 at Direct range. The caster cannot wield the Lance in melee but can throw it at a target as close as 5 feet away.

If struck, the target suffers d12 + SI point impact with SI Armour Reduction, as well as d4 + SI fire impact (CS increase both point and fire impacts by half SI). Only the point aspect impact receives the modifiers for range (page 163, step 2). Resolve the injuries consecutively, first the point and then the fire, although they do not compound (page 168). The injuries can lead to two separate Shock Rolls, with Shock States applied one after the other (page 169). The Lance corrodes to nothing upon striking a target, the ground, or an object, or at the end of duration.

- 7 Base Range becomes SI × 10 feet.
- 8 The caster receives +10 bonus to throwing test when the Lance is hurled at spellfire.
- 9 The caster receives one bonus Precision TA (page 171) if a target is struck.

## lustre · i

The caster rubs a wholly metallic object weighing no more than SI pounds, removing rust, corrosion, and dirt from its surface.

- 7 Spell restores corrosion damage, rather than simply removing the rust.
- 8 May be cast on mostly metallic objects.
- 9 Spell removes one point of Weapon Damage to a weapon. May be cast once per instance of damage.

Time:

## magnet · ii

One designated hand of the caster becomes magnetised. Mostly or wholly metallic objects weighing in total no more than SI × 2 pounds that the caster touches are affected-'stuck' to the mage's hand. The effect also increases the caster's grip on such objects, lending SI bonus to Strength Rolls to take targeted objects from someone holding them or to retain hold of magnetised objects (page 106). The mage has the option not to have a touched object 'stick' to the magnetised hand, and may freely release specified objects and pick others up, as long as the total weight of currently held magnetised objects does exceed the weight limit.

- 7 The spell affects partly metallic objects.
- 8 Two target objects become magnetised to each other , rather than to the caster. Their effective Strength Roll 'grip' is the mage's own STR plus Magnet SI.
- 9 Range becomes half SI × 5 feet; as a free action a designated object may be drawn 'telekinetically' to the caster's hand.

Time:

## mend · iii

Usually a workshop is required to restore WQ to a weapon that has suffered more than one point of damage. Mend restores 2 WQ to a wholly metallic non-enchanted weapon no matter its damage and without a workshop (CS 3 WQ).

- 7 May be cast on the metallic parts of mostly and partly metallic objects.
- 8 May be cast on enchanted weapons.
- 9 A Success (S) mends 3 WQ (CS 4 WQ).

## mephitis · iv

A foul-smelling, dense vapour issues from the air at a point designated within range. The yellowish-brown cloud billows out to a radius of half SI × 5 feet, blocking LOS. The environs' Windforce (0-4) dictates how far the cloud drifts with the wind at the end of the caster's turn each round, and how long it lasts before dispersing:

| windforce   | drift                     | duration                  |
|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| 0 Light     | None                      | SI×10 rd                  |
| 1 Moderate  | 10 ft per rd              | SI×5 rd                   |
| 2 Strong    | 20ft per rd               | SI×2 rd                   |
| 3 Gale      | 40ft per rd               | SI rd                     |
| 4 Storm     | - immediately dispersed - | - immediately dispersed - |

The first time creatures other than the caster are within the cloud they suffer a SHK 7 attack (CS -20 penalty to Shock Roll). After their first exposure to the Mephitis, creatures do not suffer further shock from it on subsequent rounds.

- 7 By concentrating for a round, the caster counteracts the cloud's drift from wind by 10 feet per round, or, if WF0, may move it 10 feet in any direction.
- 8 By concentrating for a round, the caster counteracts the cloud's drift from wind by 20 feet per round, or may move a cloud in WF0 or WF1 winds 20 or 10 feet, respectively, in any direction.
- 9 Anyone the caster designates is immune to the cloud's effect as long as they remain touching the mage.

Time:

## mould · v

The caster changes the shape of a wholly metallic object weighing no more than SI × 2 pounds. The caster could cast Mould to bend or straighten an iron bar or warp a sheet of steel. When duration expires, the object reverts to normal. The base spell has no effect on arcane artefacts, not even those without a Ward, nor does it affect objects in Consonance (page 209) with a living being.

If range is touch, the caster may manipulate up to SI separate objects whose total weight does not exceed SI × 2 pounds. For example, door hinges could be moulded for easier-or more difficult-access. If the separate objects are not close enough to be touched at least once during casting Time without the caster moving, then the mage may maintain concentration after spellfire to reach and touch them if they are within SI × 5 feet of each other (maximum half Move per turn while concentrating).

Duration varies by Range: SI minutes (Touch) or SI rounds (SI × 5 feet).

- 7 May be cast on the metallic parts of mostly metallic objects.
- 8 The spell can affect an Indefinite minor artefact that is not warded.
- 9 The spell can affect an unwarded Indefinite major artefact, but the artefact resists the effect if it is victorious in an opposed Volition ML test against the Casting Roll (break ties).

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

Touch or SI × 5 feet

Duration:

Varies (see above)

## protection · i

The caster protects a wholly metallic object weighing no more than SI pounds against its next single instance of Weapon Damage (page 191). The spell ends either after preventing the instance, or after duration.

- 7 May be cast on mostly metallic objects.
- 8 Protection extends to two instances.
- 9 Protection extends to three instances.

Time:

Free action

Range:

Touch

Duration:

SI days (CS Indefinite)

## repel · iii

The caster exudes Jmorvi principles to such a degree that active souls may not engage the mage's dormant soul in Spirit Conflict, and objects in consonance (page 209) with the mage are immune to Animation. The spell does not 'repel' spirits who are Incarnated (page 393).

- 7 The effect extends to the entire astral locale that corresponds to where the mage is in the physical world (page 293).
- 8 Incarnated spirits suffer a  -20 penalty to all tests taken within 10 feet of the mage, or a -10 penalty if within 11 to 30 feet.
- 9 Effect may be cast on an unenchanted wholly metallic object. Range is Touch.

Time:

1 round

Range:

Self

Duration:

SI  minutes (SI × 10 minutes)

## restoration · v

The caster restores a dispelled enchantment and its foundational Vessel spell in a wholly metallic minor artefact. The caster must identify and know the enchantment spell. The Casting Roll is modified according to the elapsed time since the power was lost or dispelled:

| time lapse    |   modifier |
|---------------|------------|
| Upto5days     |          0 |
| …1month       |         -5 |
| …1year        |        -10 |
| …10years      |        -20 |
| …100years     |        -40 |
| …1000years    |        -70 |
| …10,000 years |       -100 |

A casting failure (F) with a units die result of 1-or any critical failure (CF)-means the enchantment is irretrievably lost.

- 7 Caster need not be capable of personally casting the enchantment to restore it.
- 8 May be cast to immediately restore a major artefact suffering Ego Subversion. See the Subvert spell (page 254).
- 9 May be cast to restore one major artefact enchantment and Vessel.

## screen · vi

The skin of the caster acquires a greyblue-black glamour, giving SI Armour Value to all Locations (including Area AV), cumulative with any clothing and armour worn. Such locations acquire the Rigid Armour trait (page 111), if not already having it, and the plate Metal Armour trait (page 133), if that option is in play.

The enchanted skin briefly stiffens when it suffers trauma but, otherwise, retains its natural flexibility. Thus, it protects against all types of impact rolls, such as from enemy strikes or falling damage. Screen does not grant the ability to strike a target with an 'iron fist'.

- 7 Screen may be cast on another being touched by the caster, but duration becomes SI rounds.
- 8 The mage (only) may increase the Screen's AV by 2 for a single instance of known impact, announced right before impact is rolled. Each such increase reduces duration by one minute.
- 9 The mage (only) may increase the Screen's AV by 4 for a single instance of known impact, announced right before impact is rolled. Each such increase reduces duration by two minutes.

## shatter · vi

The spell causes an at least partially metallic non-enchanted, non-warded weapon to suffer 1 point of Weapon Damage each time it successfully strikes or is blocked (Shatter CS 2 points). If the affected weapon achieves a CS strike, then increase this damage suffered by 1. All Weapon Damage is in addition to what may normally occur from blocks.

- 7 One point of Weapon Damage is immediately inflicted at spellfire.
- 8 Spell may work on enchanted minor artefact weapons.
- 9 Spell may target a major artefact weapon, but spellfire has a penalty equal to half the weapon's Volition ×5.

Time:

## shroud · v

A faint golden glow extends a few inches from the caster's body. The impact of wholly or mostly metallic weapons or objects entering the shroud is reduced by 4 (CS 8). The impact of partially metallic weapons or objects is reduced by 2 (CS 4).

- 7 If Shroud helps reduce Impact to less than 1 from a melee weapon, then the wielder must make a Fumble Roll.
- 8 Impact reduction increases by 1.
- 9 Impact reduction increases by 2.

## sight · i

The caster can evaluate the quality of a wholly metallic object weighing no more than SI pounds. This can reveal Weapon or Star Quality, or a coin's purity.

- 7 May evaluate a mostly metallic object.
- 8 May evaluate at once separate items that together weigh no more than SI pounds, such as a pouch of mixed coins.
- 9 Spell may be cast to detect and identify one designated metallic mineral, such as gold or silver, within half SI × 5 feet.

## singing sword · iii

The caster targets an unenchanted mostly or wholly metallic object weighing no more than SI pounds, and it begins to resonate loudly. If held, the wielder suffers an accumulating -5 penalty from vibrations each round, starting at spellfire and measured from the end of the caster's turn (up to SI × 5 maximum penalty). The penalty applies to any Dexteritybased test, such as Melee, Throwing, or Legerdemain. Each round, at the start of their turn, wielders make a Strength test-a success reduces the current round's total penalty by 5 (CS 10).

The same penalty applies to all Awareness (hearing) tests made by those near the object except the caster. Each 5 feet of distance from the object offsets the current penalty by 5. The wielder's STR test has no effect on this penalty.

- 7 If the object is held, the mage may have the wielder make a Fumble roll at spellfire.
- 8 Spell affects unwarded Indefinite minor and major artefacts, but major artefacts still resist the effect if they are victorious in an opposed Volition ML test against the Casting Roll (break ties).
- 9 The target object suffers a surge of heat at spellfire. If cast on a held object, the wielder makes a Fumble Roll at spellfire and also suffers a one-time d4 + 3 f impact to the location in contact with the object (AV applies).

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

SI × 5 feet in LOS

Duration:

## steel · iv

The mage follows the Artefact Creation Sequence (pages 256-257) and enchants a mostly ( axe ) or wholly ( sword ) metallic weapon weighing between 1 and SI pounds as a minor or major artefact. The Steel enchantment allows the weapon to ignore all Weapon Damage except that delivered by a weapon itself enchanted with either Steel or Charm (Jmorvi III).

- 7 Spell reduces Weapon Damage by 5 from a Steel- or Charm-enchanted weapon.
- 8 May be cast on partly metallic weapons (such as polearms).
- 9 As Bonus Effect 7, but reduction is 10.

Time:

Duration:

Continuous artefact effect

## swordbreaker · iv

The mage follows the Artefact Creation Sequence (pages 256-257) and enchants a single wholly metallic weapon weighing between 1 and SI pounds as a minor or major artefact. The Swordbreaker enchantment allows the weapon to roll for Weapon Damage on all successful Blocks regardless of any tie break, and regardless of whether the Swordbreaker weapon is the striking or the blocking weapon (see Weapon Damage on page 191). Swordbreaker also increases impact for determining Weapon Damage by 5. On a CS versus CS Block, Weapon Damage increases by 10.

- 7 The spell affects mostly metallic weapons (such as axes).
- 8 The spell affects partly metallic weapons (such as polearms).
- 9 Impact for determining Weapon Damage increases by 5 more.

Time:

10 hours

Range:

## tempering · ii

Tempering increases the Weapon Quality of a wholly metallic weapon by 1 (CS 2). It may only be cast once on the same weapon at the same time, and may only be cast on non-enchanted weapons, which are still considered 'non-enchanted' with regard to whether they can be struck by non-enchanted weapons.

If cast on the weapon at the very end of its construction, the spell has an Indefinite duration (CS Permanent).

- 7 Spell affects mostly metallic weapons (such as axes).
- 8 Casting CS improves WQ by 3.

## the powers of pèleáhn

The core principle of Peleahn magic is fire-between the powerful heat of worked Jmorvi metal and the brisk, mercurial quality of Lyahvi air. Peleahn mages often demonstrate a passionate and undisciplined creativity that can quickly turn impatient and volatile.

## Ethereal Fire

Many Peleahn spells enable mages to channel fire principle into the physical world. Such ethereal fire concurrently exists in both the spirit and physical worlds. It is more translucent than mundane fire and illuminates to only half its distance. While ethereal fire does not set mundane fuels alight, touching it or being touched by it is painful, even lethal in extreme cases.

Ethereal Burn : touching or being touched by ethereal fire inflicts an ethereal burn. This does not leave an actual burn injury but instead causes the target to make a Shock Roll, often against SHK 7. There is no f -aspect impact and body location is irrelevant.

Ethereal Heat : targets do not risk direct shock or injury, but a victim affected by ethereal heat for an hour suffers a Heat Hazard (page 149).

Ethereal Smoke : some Peleahn effects produce ethereal smoke. While not opaque like thick mundane smoke, ethereal smoke is only semitransparent and so tests requiring LOS into or through it suffer a -10 penalty. Those engulfed in it also are subjected to a weak form of asphyxiation with doubled associated time periods (page 183).

## major pèleáhn chantries

CHANTRY QUALITY

## elemental objects

Peleahn elemental objects must all retain heat and remain dry, for instance a censer, lantern, or fire-pot. Most importantly, they must stay lit to be of any benefit. A chain censer burns for an hour using a pound of charcoal tinder (see page 121 for both items).

## seed fire

Often Peleahn magic requires the mage to be near a larger source of mundane fire than their elemental object provides. This source is called a seed fire, rated by four fire sizes (FS 1-4):

|   fs | amount      | diameter   | examples        |
|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
|    0 | Scant       | 1 in       | censer, lantern |
|    1 | Trace       | 1 ft       | torch           |
|    2 | Minor       | 3 ft       | campfire        |
|    3 | Substantial | 10 ft      | large fire      |
|    4 | Great       | 20ft       | bonfire         |

These are the same fire sizes used to describe shamanic Fire Spirit Powers and an elemental's bound form. Fires bigger than FS4, such as a burning building or a forest fire, are still rated as Great seed fires.

## convocational effects

Below are ten Peleahn effects as examples for Spontaneous Casting (page 207).

Fire	•	Heat	•	Dryness	•	Smoke	•	Action

- 1 A	slim	ring	of	ethereal	fire	surrounds	one of	the	caster's	fingers.

## brand · iii

The caster touches an unenchanted object weighing between 1 and SI pounds and envelops it in ethereal fire (Casting Roll must include Object Element modifier, page 201). A target who is touched by or touches the object suffers a SHK 7 ethereal burn (CS -20 penalty to Shock test), in addition to any injury imparted by the object. The effect ends after half SI touches or duration.

- 7 The effect may continue for one extra touch but duration stays the same.

## burn · vi

The caster wreathes a target in ethereal fire for duration. On the first round the victim suffers a SHK 7 ethereal burn, modified by a Shock test (page 169). Every other round of duration on the mage's turn, the victim tests Shock. Any failure increases the current Shock State Index by 1, up to a maximum of 9.

- 7 A target touched by the caster at spellfire suffers -20 penalty to the Shock test.

## conflagration · iv

Natural fuel, such as dry grass or a pool of oil, bursts into flame. Resistant fuels (wet grass, peat, forest humus) ignite but duration is halved. Showers further halve duration, while continuous precipitation prevents all fuels from burning at all.

The Conflagration covers a radius of half SI × 5 feet centred on a point the caster selects within range. Each round after spellfire on the caster's turn, the radius expands by half SI × 5 feet to the extent of its natural limit, consuming the given fuel as it expands (resistant fuels expand only every other round). The entire Conflagration 'circle' then drifts a number of feet in the direction of the wind according to the table in the Mephitis spell description (page 222). Affected inflamed areas left behind by such drift are immediately extinguished.

Each round creatures remain within the flames, they suffer an Area attack of d4+ SI Fire Impact. The conflagration usually does not last long enough to induce asphyxia (page 183), but all suffer -10 penalty from irritation. The caster is not immune to any of the effects.

At the end of duration, the entire Conflagration disappears, leaving fuels affected at any point burnt and destroyed.

- 7 Caster becomes immune to the smoke but not the fire for duration.
- 8 Caster may limit the Conflagration to the initial area-it will not expand (but still drifts from wind).
- 9 Range becomes SI × 60 feet in LOS.

## convoke · vi

The caster summons a Minor Beleras from its primal plane and binds it to a host mass within range at least the size of a campfire (see Elemental Substances table, page 359). With spellfire success, the elemental tests Spirit in opposition to the Casting Roll (do not break ties: ).

## opposed convoke-spirit test

- 1 The Béleras remains bound to its host mass as a free elemental (page	358).	If	possible, it tries	to	flee	the	mage,	attacking	if	necessary.
- The	Béleras	returns	to	its	primal	plane.
- 1 The	mage	controls	the	Béleras	for	duration, then	it	returns	to	its	primal	plane.
- 2 The mage controls the Béleras for double the	duration,	then	it	returns	to	its	primal plane.
- 3 The mage controls the Béleras for triple the duration.	The	mage	may	then	leave	it	bound to its host mass as a free elemental or allow it	to	return	to	its	primal	plane.

These results are in addition to those of the Casting Roll table (page 202).

A mage who successfully controls the Beleras may take 1-turn actions starting on the following round to command it to perform any action within its power (page 360). Both the mage's command and the Beleras action take place on the mage's Initiative Rank (IR).

- 7 Caster may convoke a Substantial Beleras into a host mass at least the size of a large fire (page 359).
- 8 The Beleras has -10 penalty to the opposed Spirit test.
- 9 Caster may convoke a Great Beleras into a host mass at least the size of a bonfire (page 359).

## doom curtain · v

Throughout casting time the mage quickly passes a hand through the flames of at least a small seed fire (campfire size). At spellfire a 5-foot thick and 10-foot tall ring of fire springs up around the seed fire. The clear zone between the seed fire and the ring may by up to SI × 5 feet in radius. The Curtain remains stationary for duration, but it naturally ignites flammable objects it touches. When the spell ends, the seed fire, Doom Curtain, and any newly ignited flames immediately expire (as if they lost all oxygen).

A creature touching the curtain suffers a burn of d4 + SI Impact (CS +5). If fully immersed in the Doom Curtain, the victim suffers an Area attack of the same impact. The caster is not immune.

- 7 As a free action after spellfire, caster may open a gap five feet wide in the curtain for safe passage for one round.
- 8 Caster may contract and expand the radius of the ring at will, not exceeding its normal maximum.
- 9 The spell may be cast and modified outside the ring, up to SI × 30 feet away from the seed fire. The caster must have LOS to the seed at spellfire and then later LOS to the curtain to modify it.

Talent bonus: Elemental Fire Bolt

The caster creates a handful of mundane fire from a seed flame within 5 feet and then hurls it to a designated spot within range, where the flame explodes into a ball of fire half SI × 5 feet in diameter. All within it suffer an Area attack of d4 + SI Fire impact (CS +4).

The ball is slow-moving enough that creatures who see the caster hurl it may proactively take the Evade action (page 166). If electing to do so, they resolve the Evade action now for the Area attack, but apply it as the action on their next IR.

- 7 Dodge tests have a -20 penalty.
- 8 If caster explodes the ball within SI × 5 feet, targets must succeed on an Initiative test to take Evade action proactively.
- 9 The ball's traverse may originate from a seed fire of at least FS2 within SI × 10 feet and LOS of the caster.

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

SI × 30 feet in LOS

Duration:

## envelope · iv

A spherical zone of ethereal fire extends in a 5-foot radius beyond the caster, who must concentrate and remain stationary throughout duration. The ethereal fire produces an outer heat haze area that extends further beyond the ethereal fire to a radius of SI × 5 feet from the mage.

Conscious creatures within or moving into the outer heat haze area become uncomfortably warm and must immediately make a Fear Roll (CS caster may include Aberrance 1); see page 187.

Creatures encountering the inner ethereal fire zone first make a Shock test (page 169) against a SHK 7 Ethereal Burn. If still conscious, or upon becoming so within the Envelope, the creature then also suffers the heat haze , as above.

- 7 Caster may designate SI touched creatures as immune to the effect.
- 8 Caster may include ABE 1 with the Fear Roll of the heat haze (CS ABE2).
- 9 Caster may drop concentration and move after spellfire; the zones remain in their original place for duration.

## eyes · iii

The caster's eyes emit a faint orange glow. Regular vision is replaced with the ability to perceive distinctions in heat instead of light. This 'infra-vision' does not distinguish between objects of similar temperature, nor pick out exact details, especially at a distance. The caster tests Awareness to interpret each viewed object (-10 penalty for every full SI × 5 feet away). An Awareness Success gives only general information (a CS reveals more detail).

- 7 As a free action once per turn, the caster may change from heat vision to regular vision, or vice versa. Each change back to heat vision halves duration.
- 8 Awareness penalty halved; details improve with S (CS to near-normal vision level).
- 9 The spell can be laid on a creature the caster touches.

Time:

1 round

Range:

Self

Duration:

SI × 2 minutes

## fever · iv

A creature touched by the caster contracts an ethereal fever which imparts 10 weakness fatigue and SHK 6 (CS SHK 7). Instead of a Shock Roll, every 24 hours thereafter, the victim tests Spirit :

## spirit test

- cf SHK	increases	by	2.	(maximum	SHK 9); and	victim	acquires	1	Psyche	Stress	Level.
- f SHK	increases	by	1	(maximum	SHK 8);	and victim	acquires	1	Psyche	Stress	Level.
- s SHK	decreases	by	1.
- cs SHK	decreases	by	2.

The victim suffers indefinitely from the weakness and corresponding Shock State, recovering when SHK is reduced to 0 (which ends the spell) or after duration. Psyche Stress Levels last independently of the spell's duration; the victim acquires the Psyche Trait and begins Psyche Stress Recovery (page 189) once the spell is over.

- 7 Caster may set victim's Spirit tests to occur once every 4 hours.
- 8 Caster may delay the fever's onset by up to SI × 4 hours.
- 9 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS.

## fire fiend · vi

The caster turns a small to large mundane seed fire within SI feet into an amorphous fire 'creature'. The caster controls the Fire Fiend by staying within SI×5 feet of it. The Fiend cannot move.

As a 1-turn action, the caster may direct it to make a melee attack against one target with the ML and within the range ( rng ) indicated below. The target may only Dodge with -20 penalty due to the Fiend's flickering quickness. The characteristics of the strike depend upon the size of the originating seed fire (CS Fiend attack does +5 impact).

| size   | rng   |   ml | zd   | fire impact   |
|--------|-------|------|------|---------------|
| Small  | 5'    |   90 | d8   | d4+half SI    |
| Medium | 10'   |   80 | d6   | d4+half SI+1  |
| Large  | 15'   |   70 | d4   | d4+half SI+2  |

- 7 Fire Fiend may make an attack out to double range ( rng ) with a -10 penalty.
- 8 Fire Fiend may make an attack out to triple range ( rng ) with a -20 penalty.

## fireworks · ii

The caster quickly passes a hand through a seed fire throughout casting time. At spellfire the mage reforms the fire's shape and the colour of its smoke as desired, changing it into a pyrotechnic display of the same size. The display remains amorphous and insubstantial-observers usually understand its 'spectacular' or 'odd' nature (CS caster may include a quality that imparts Aberrance 1, page 187). While so morphed into a display, the seed fire does not ignite combustible material or cause injury.

7

- Caster may situate the display up to SI × 20 feet from the seed fire. The display does not ignite combustible material or cause injury but the seed fire remains intact and dangerous.
- 8 Touching the source no longer required; range becomes SI × 10 feet.
- 9 The Fireworks can be one size larger than the source seed fire.

## flame · i

With available fuel (even if unlit), the caster immediately ignites or enhances a fire to its fullest size. With damp fuel, or if the weather consists of showers or continuous rain, a fire still burns but will only grow one Fire Size per round.

- 7 Fuel added to an affected fire after casting burns twice as long.
- 8 Range becomes SI × 5 feet.

## gauntlet · v

The caster's hand or Peleahn elemental object becomes wreathed in ethereal fire with half SI points (CS SI points). Each time a creature is touched by the hand or object, the caster may spend 1 point to inflict an Ethereal Burn with a SHK 7, or 2 points to inflict a SHK 8. The spell ends when all points are expended.

- 7 Caster may place spell effect on a metallic or wooden object, but Object Element penalties apply (page 201 sidebar). These are the only non-Peleahn elemental objects allowed.
- 8 Victim Shock Rolls include -20 penalty.
- 9 Caster may project the effect to a range of SI × 10 feet in LOS, with no chance for the target to dodge.

Hastening example : a mage with Hastening ML65 uses a Free action on her Initiative Rank 60 to begin spellstart and then takes the 1-turn Incant action on the very same turn to make the Casting Roll. Including -10 penalty from the noisy melee, the test is against EML55-a 35 roll gives a Critical Success (CS) and no Fatigue accrual (0 from the CS and 0 from Haste's Complexity Level II).

For the next 36 rounds (tripled duration from the CS), her Move increases from 55 to 85 and she receives an increase of 30 to Dodge ML and an increase of 20 to Initiative Rank (to IR80) and Melee ML. When Duration ends, the mage accrues 5 windedness fatigue, despite not accruing any from the CS Casting Roll itself. Once she reaches Hastening ML70, even this 5 fatigue could be eliminated with an END SR.

## hastening · ii

The caster's reaction response is enhanced. Move and Dodge ML are increased by 20 (CS 30); Initiative Rank (IR) and Melee ML increase by 10 (CS 20). At the end of duration, the subject gains 5 windedness fatigue, in addition to any gained at spellfire or from other sources.

- 7 Fatigue accrual after duration is reduced by 5 if subject succeeds on an END SR.
- The spell may be laid on a person the

## heat · i

A mundane fire burns twice as long (CS three times as long). More fuel may be added to it within SI minutes of spellfire.

If  the spell is instead placed on the caster's Peleahn elemental object, its effective Fire Size increases by 1 for SI hours. So, while the elemental object's fire is not literally larger, its size with regard to being a seed fire increases.

- 7 Caster may eliminate smoke from the object fire without it losing its ability to serve as a seed fire for the mage.

- Immune to physical damage.

Once per turn as a free action, the caster (or subject; see Bonus Effect 9) may test Spirit to attempt one of the following Immolation Feats . As a 1-turn action, the caster may try a second on the same IR (even the same feat again, unless noted):

- [1]  Resist automatically rising.
- [2] Squeeze through a narrow opening at least 15-SI inches wide.
- [3] Descend 10 feet (Spirit CS 20 feet).
- [4] Reduce effective Windforce by 1 (Spirit CS by 2) for calculating turn's drift. See Mephitis spell (page 222).
- [5] Touch a creature (only once per turn).
6. 7 Caster receives +20 bonus to the Spirit test required by Immolation feats.
7. 8 Caster gains lateral control during a move action. The mage may go SI × 10 feet in a desired direction but is still subject to natural wind and must test Will or gain 5 fatigue per such move.
8. 9 Spell may be cast on a conscious, willing person touched by the caster, but the target must test Spirit at spellfire:

## spirit test

## mantle · vi

The caster becomes shrouded in a very faint glow of ethereal fire that completely protects against mundane fire and heat. Up to half Spirit ML pounds of clothing and gear are included in the effect. When shrouded, the caster's touch inflicts a SHK 7 Ethereal Burn (CS -20 penalty to Shock Roll). Each instance of fire/heat protection, and each touch of ethereal fire, reduces duration by one minute.

When the Mantle is not currently protecting against fire, viewers must test Awareness to see its glow in full or dim light. The Mantle automatically shows up in darkness or at night. While protecting or inflicting burn, it flickers brightly, so no test is necessary to notice it.

- 7 Caster may touch creatures without inflicting ethereal burn.
- 8 Caster may suppress the glow in full or dim light when not protecting or burning.
- 9 The spell can target a person the caster touches. Duration is SI rounds.

## meteor · v

The caster and half Spirit ML pounds of clothing and gear turn into ethereal smoke about the size of the caster's body.

The smoke drifts along the ground with the wind for 3d4 hours. For this entire period, generate

| a single Wind Force                    | wf   | driftperhr   |
|----------------------------------------|------|--------------|
| and Direction                          | 0    | 1 league     |
| (Weather Lore, page                    | 1    | 1d6 leagues  |
| 64), and then roll                     | 2    | 2d6 leagues  |
| the precise distance drifted each hour | 3    | 3d6 leagues  |

| Force (right).                         |      |              |

The spell has a 10% chance of ending for each full 100-foot width of water the drifting subject's path crosses. Thus, only prominent rivers and large bodies of water induce a roll. If the spell does terminate, it happens just before the traversal, at the shore's edge.

When the spell ends or is terminated, the caster rematerialises, standing upright and fully conscious.

Creatures touching the fire or object suffer either a d4+o f burn if they are able to let go or escape it immediately; or a d4+3 f burn if unable to (CS +3 f in both cases). Caster is immune to such burns from Pyre.

## seeker · v

The caster designates a being within range and LOS. At spellfire this target exudes a trace of ethereal heat that only the caster sees. It leaves a 'trail' the caster can automatically follow for duration. If the target is immersed entirely in water or continuous rain, the spell ends.

- 7 The spell does not end even if the target is in continuous rain.
- 8 A CS prevents the spell ending even if the target is immersed in water.

## shooting star · iii

The caster creates a handful of ethereal fire from a seed fire within SI feet and then throws it in a perfectly straight line. Aware creatures in its path receive a Dodge test to avoid being directly struck. Upon hitting water or reaching SI × 30 feet without encountering a solid object or creature, the missile fades out.

If it strikes a solid object or creature, the Shooting Star explodes. Creatures nearby must make a Shock Roll from ethereal burn. The Shock effect varies by their distance from the explosion point:

## distance

## shock effect

Directly	struck

SHK 7	(-20	Shock	test	penalty)

Half	SI×5 feet

SHK 7

SI×5 feet

SHK 6

Each target in the explosion creates a 'shadow' that grants a +10 Shock Roll bonus to others directly beyond. The Shock effect does not pass through water.

- 7 Seed fire no longer required. If one is used, add its Fire Size (page 225 sidebar) to the SI for calculating maximum range and explosion radius.
- 8 Caster may command the Star to explode at any point along its traverse.
- 9 Caster may have the Star shoot out from a seed fire within SI × 30 feet and LOS of the caster. Its traverse to the target point follows the above rules.

Time:

Shooting Star Example : a Peleahn mage with Shooting Star ML88 carries a burning torch (Seed Fire Size 1). Facing five mounted Agrikan knights 250 feet away, the mage chooses the Quicken option (free action Time) to make the Casting Roll on her current IR.

The Shooting Star EML is 68 (-20 from the Quicken). The mage targets the centre rider and may name the precise distance to explode the Star (Bonus Effect 8). Drawing from the torch as a seed fire, the Peleahn has an effective SI9 with the spell, giving it a 270-foot range. It explodes upon striking the middle rider (SHK 7 with -20 penalty to Shock Roll); all other riders and horses are within 20 feet (SHK 7).

## skin · ii

The caster receives Armour Value against fire impact equal to half SI (CS SI). The amount combines with the AV afforded by clothing and armour.

- 7 The spell may be laid on one person the caster touches.
- 8 The spell prevents worn clothing and armour from catching fire.
- 9 The spell may be laid on an object (apply Object Element modifier, page 201).

## sphere · i

The caster creates in hand a small sphere of orange-red, flickering ethereal fire two inches in diameter. The sphere illuminates a radius of half SI × 5 feet. The caster may turn it off as a free action; turning it back on (a free action) reduces duration by one minute. As a 1-turn action, the caster may move the Sphere between hand and elemental object (or vice versa). Other creatures touched by it suffer a SHK 6 ethereal burn.

- 7 As a free action the caster may alter the illumination into a 60° cone with an extent of SI × 5 feet, or back again.
- 8 Sphere may hover within SI feet of caster.
- 9 After spellfire, caster may place the Sphere on an inanimate object as a 1-turn action. Duration becomes SI minutes or is halved, whichever is less.

## thirst · ii

The caster touches a creature and it suffers an immediate onset of thirst with a starting virulence of HR4 (page 186). As the Outcome table indicates on page 184, the victim at once accrues 10 weakness fatigue. Recovery follows its natural schedule: consuming a full ration arrests the Advance Roll and lets the character make a Healing Roll once per day; consuming a half ration is still thirst.

The thirst ends after the character naturally overcomes it or at the end of Duration. In the last case, the character immediately loses any weakness fatigue or Shock State associated with the thirst.

- 7 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS.
- 8 With no water, the creature makes an Advance Roll every 12 hours ; with half rations, every day .
- 9 Spell affects up to half SI creatures.

## wall · iv

The caster creates within range a wall of ethereal fire 1 foot thick, 10 feet high and 20 feet long (CS 60 feet long). At spellfire, all of it must be within LOS.

Any round after spellfire, as a 1-turn action, the caster may touch the wall and move it 5 feet. Any creature coming in contact with the wall suffers a SHK 7 ethereal burn (CS -20 penalty to Shock Roll). Aware creatures may test Dodge to get out of the way of the moving wall. If successful, they still must be able to move 5 feet to a non-Wall space; otherwise, they suffer the ethereal burn.

Casters may pass through the wall without harm. They may touch up to SI others at any point of duration to allow them to pass through unharmed as well.

- 7 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS. Caster must still touch the Wall to move it.
- 8 Range to move the wall becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS.
- 9 At spellfire the caster may bend the wall's shape, as long as its total volume remains the same. For example, it could be made to go around a corner.

CHANTRY QUALITY

## the phantasms of lyáhvi

The core principle of Lyahvi magic is air-between the swift, bright nature of Peleahn fire and the unseen world of Savoryan aura. Lyahvi mages often appear impartial or inscrutable, while at other times, less flatteringly, aloof and even dissembling. ·HÁCHERDAD

## Illusion

Lyahvi spells include the convocational effect of Illusions, specifically those that interact with a target's Perception, such as sight (Light), hearing (Sound), and smell (Air). Such phantasms are limited to airborne phenomena and are unable to express the tactile qualities related to objects, the convocational aegis of Jmorvi.

Illusions created by Lyahvi mages actually manifest in the surrounding environment, so any who can sense them are potential targets. While the illusions lack physicality, and cannot directly injure creatures, those strongly fooled by them could suffer trauma indirectly, as with injuries from carelessly jumping through an illusory bridge, or psyche stress from experiencing real fright at a 'ghost's' appearance.

Lyahvi illusions do not have unfailing hold over affected targets, even after spellfire. While their level of believability increases with the mage's skill, Awareness and Perception tests can end them. Only the most powerful illusions stand up to a target's direct, wilful interaction.

The visible, audible, and olfactory qualities of illusions should be compared with the mind effects of some Savorya spells (page 237). While the convocations share a mutual Secondary affinity, the distinction between Lyahvi illusion and Savorya compulsion is clear: illusions are external to the target, in the environment, potentially widespread in reach, but fleeting and not foolproof. By contrast, Savorya compulsions are internal to a single target, stronger in their emotional grip on the victim, and durable once manifest.

## major lyáhvi chantries

<!-- image -->

## elemental objects

Lyahvi elemental objects impart some sense of deflection and ambiguity, for instance a gem (especially a red ruby), prism, lens, glass, or mirror.

## convocational effects

Below are ten Lyahvi effects as examples for Spontaneous Casting (page 207).

Air	•	Light	•	Illusion	•	Incorporeality	•	Sound

- 1 A strong breeze emanates from the caster in	all	directions	(WF 1).
- 2 A small bubble of air surrounds the caster's	head,	driving	away	impure	air, such	as	pipe	smoke.
- 3 Light	rays	bend	about	the	caster's	body, causing	it	to	shimmer	briefly.
- 4 A halo of bright light bursts around the caster's	body.
- 5 A	flickering	double	of	the	caster's	body quickly	appears	mere	inches	away	and then	disappears.
- 6 The	caster	suddenly	appears	grand	and imposing	to	anyone	viewing	close	by.
- 7 The	caster's	body	quickly	becomes	slightly transparent	and	then	opaque	again.
- 8 The	caster	briefly	exudes	a	pleasant,	but nearly	imperceptible,	odour	(+5	bonus	to an	immediate	Charm	test).
- 9 A	very	faint	crackling	sound	emanates from	the	caster.

An object touched by the mage sheds light in a radius up to SI × 5 feet. Apply Object Element modifiers (page 201) to the Casting Roll. If the mage has attunement with the object, include a +10 bonus. For example, targeting an attuned Jmorvi (metal) object produces a -10 penalty (-20 Tertiary + 10 for being attuned).

If the object touched is the caster's Focus, the shape of the illumination may be a cone up to SI×10 feet long and up to SI×2 feet wide at its extent.

- 7 The caster may modify the light's radius and dimness, or turn it off and on, throughout the spell's duration.

The caster may direct the Beam to strike automatically a specified target body in LOS. Fire Impact equals d4 + SI (CS +5) in one location (ZD d6; LD d10). The beam leaves an illuminating glow five feet wide along its entire path for 1 round following spellfire.

- 7 Beam may emanate from the caster (no elemental object needed).
- 8 The beam may emanate from a nonattuned elemental object within SI × 5 feet. Object Element modifier applies to Casting Roll.

## call · vi

The caster summons a Minor Ahvisian from its primal plane and binds it to at least a ten-foot cube host mass within range, such as simply the surrounding air. With spellfire success, the elemental tests Spirit in opposition to the Casting Roll (do not break ties: ).

## opposed call-spirit test

- 1 The Àhvisían remains bound to its host mass as a free elemental (page	358).	If	possible, it tries	to	flee	the	mage,	attacking	if	necessary.
- The	Àhvisían	returns	to	its	primal	plane.
- 1 The	mage	controls	the	Àhvisían	for	duration, and	then	it	returns	to	its	primal	plane.
- 2 The mage controls the Àhvisían for double the	duration,	and	then	it	returns	to	its primal	plane.
- 3 The mage controls the Àhvisían for triple the duration.	The	mage	may	then	leave	it	bound to its host mass as a free elemental or allow it	to	return	to	its	primal	plane.

These results are in addition to those of the Casting Roll table (page 202).

A mage who successfully controls the Ahvisian may take 1-turn actions starting on the following round to command it to perform any action within its power (page 360). Both the mage's command and the Ahvisian's action take place on the mage's Initiative Rank (IR).

- 7 Caster may call a Substantial Ahvisian into a 20-foot cube host mass.
- 8 The Ahvisian has -10 penalty to the opposed Spirit test.

## caecity · iii

The caster causes one creature touched to suffer the illusion of blindness. The target makes a Spirit test on the table below to determine whether and how long the blindness lasts (Caecity CS -20 penalty). Suffering physical trauma from a source that could have been sensed with sight allows an affected target an immediate Spirit test-any success ends the illusion; any failure has no affect.

## curtain · iv

Talent bonus: Elemental Air Bolt

A fast-moving, shimmering distortion of air emanates out SI × 50 feet from the caster for one round after spellfire, clearing unbreathable air, such as thick smoke, in its area, and causing all missile weapon attacks to fail. The Curtain induces complete silence during the round it passes due to a sudden change in air pressure (it causes ears to pop). Those in the area on their next IR make an opposed Press Roll attack (page 106) against the Curtain's d6 + SI × 3 Press Roll.

The Curtain has no effect underwater or in environments without air.

- 7 The caster may instead create a pocket with an SI-foot radius that remains centred on the caster's head for SI × 10 minutes. The pocket freshens air but does not produce the other effects.
- 8 A pocket like in Bonus Effect 7 may be created in fire for SI rounds.

## figure · vi

Talent bonus: Disembodiment The caster and half Spirit ML pounds of worn and carried gear dematerialise. The mage enters the astralscape for half SI rounds (CS +1), and is able to Engage the Spirit World (page 294). At the end of duration, the caster must make a Reembodiment Roll (page 298).

- 7 The caster may choose to disembodyleaving a physical body behind-rather than dematerialise. Doing so increases duration by one round.
- 8 As a free action on one turn after spellfire, the mage may become semi-corporeal for one round. Afterwards, the caster once again dematerialises if any duration remains. See the Passage spell (page 235) for what semi-corporeal characters can do, how fatigue affects them, and how they can be harmed.
- 9 As Bonus Effect 8 in all respects except the mage may remain semi-corporeal for two consecutive rounds as long as they both transpire within duration.

## flash · ii

A blinding flash emanates from the caster's held elemental object. Object Element modifiers (page 201) apply to the Casting Roll. Only creatures with LOS to the caster and who are consciously looking in mage's direction are affected. In a situation like a melee where this is not evident, there is a 1 in 6 chance that creatures with LOS to the caster are looking in the mage's direction. Those so affected within half SI × 5 feet of the flash are blinded for two rounds (CS SI rounds) and Stunned (see page 169 for STN recovery). Beyond this, out to SI × 10 feet , targets are only Stunned. A shout by the caster may warn distracted allies to avert or close their eyes to avoid the effects.

- 7 The effect may be limited to a 5-foot wide line in one direction.
- 8 The effect can emanate from an elemental object within SI × 30 feet.
- 9 Up to SI creatures within LOS may be designated immune to the effect.

## glamour · v

The caster enters the Persuasion Routine (page 138) using a specific skill against one designated target within 10 feet in LOS. Before the influence test is resolved, the mage begins Glamour spellstart. Cant and gesture are masked by the exchange itself, so, while the Silent and Still options (page 201) are not available, spell recognition (page 203) is possible only by someone who also knows Glamour.

With successful spellfire, Glamour creates subtle visual, aural, and olfactory illusions that make the caster more convincing, as appropriate to the selected Persuasion skill. For Charm, this could mean a convivial look; for Discourse, a soothing voice; for Guile, a trusting glint; for Intimidation, a menacing visage; and for Theatrics, an uncanny disguise.

A successful Glamour grants the caster +1 Success Level to the Persuasion test, which immediately follows spellfire (CS +2 Success Level). Glamour brings the chance for two levels of success beyond what is normally possibleGlamour 1 (one level beyond a CS in unopposed tests; or a four-star success in opposed tests); and Glamour 2 (one level beyond Glamour 1).

Glamour 1 : targets act radically against their self-interest: a guard allows passage in the middle of a fight ; a courtier divulges state secrets in front of a superior . Only a Glamour 1 using Intimidation convinces targets to injure their own allies.

Glamour 2 : targets can be convinced to act bizarrely against their self-interest: a guard attacks allies in the middle of a fight ; a courtier divulges a secret about the earl in front of the earl. Only a Glamour 2 using Intimidation convinces targets to risk injuring themselves ( reaching into a fire ).

Witnesses allied with the target within 10 feet and LOS recognise the illusory effect with an Awareness test success level that exceeds Glamour's (break ties). The target is still affected, but successfully aware allies could intercede as they see fit.

- 7 Glamour's range of effect may extend to half SI × 5 ft in LOS to the target.
- 8 Glamour may instead bolster an ally's Persuasion test within 5  feet in LOS.
- 9 Witness Awareness tests lose all tied successes against the Casting Roll.

## globe · iii

A flickering, multicolored light one foot in diameter hovers just above the caster's head. Creatures other than the caster within SI ×5 feet and LOS to the Globe must test Spirit at the start of their turn (Globe CS -20 penalty):

## image · iii

A duplicate image of an object held by the caster, and weighing no more than half Spirit ML pounds, appears at a remote location within SI × 5 feet and LOS. Only a person within 10 feet of the image who successfully tests Awareness notices its translucent nature (Image CS -20 penalty). However, direct 'touching' of the image by an observer reveals its illusory nature. Should the caster drop or let go of the actual object, the image disappears.

- 7 Image remains in place for duration, even if caster moves out of LOS.
- 8 LOS no longer required at spellfire, but caster must have once seen the location from within SI × 50 ft.
- 9 Caster may change the image's colour and size (between half and double). It can also mimic the movement the caster makes with the object.

## lens · ii

The caster manipulates the light surrounding a single target object that weighs no more than SI × 5 pounds and that remains in LOS throughout duration. Object Element modifier does not apply, because the spell affects the light, not the object. The spell can make an object seem smaller or larger (50% to 200%) or change its colour or shape, but it must retain some element of its real nature. Lens cannot create an illusion out of nothing and there is no tactile element to it. Only a vigilant observer whose Awareness test exceeds the spell's Success Level realises this is an illusion (break ties). Tactilely interacting with the target object also reveals it as illusory.

- 7 The illusion may instead change the appearance of lighting within SI × 30 feet in LOS: for example, it may dim or brighten torch light (but not extinguish it), or make the air more opaque (as from a mist).
- 8 The illusion continues to duration even when the caster loses LOS.
- 9 The illusion may affect any number of objects within 10 feet of each other and weighing no more than SI × 5 total pounds.

Time:

## mirror · iv

The caster sees through another willing creature's eyes, though the quality of eyesight remains the caster's own. Both caster and target see what the target sees. Throughout duration, the caster's eyes must remain closed or the effect ends. If either party becomes Incapacitated or Unconscious, the effect ends. The spell has no effect if the target is blind or suffering temporary blindness.

- 7 Caster may attempt to place effect on an unwilling target. If the target's Spirit test exceeds casting Success Level (break ties), then the spell has no effect.
- 8 Throughout duration, caster may switch between own vision (open eyes) and the target's vision (closed eyes).
- 9 The effect may also include hearing, as long as the target is not deaf or suffering temporary deafness.

## motes · v

Thousands of brightly flashing and dancing pinkish spots of light extend out from the caster to a radius up to SI × 10 feet. The distraction caused by the motes causes -30 penalty to all tests requiring sight within its radius (CS -50 penalty). The caster is immune.

- 7 Caster may place spell on an object, which may be left behind without disrupting the effect. Object Element modifier (page 201) applies. Range is Touch.
- 8 Caster may touch SI creatures during the casting to designate as immune to the effect.
- 9 Caster may instead simply designate SI creatures in LOS immune to the effect.

## muffle · i

A nearly inaudible and intermittent crackling hum radiates from the caster, even while moving. It muffles surrounding noise within a radius of SI × 5 feet (CS SI × 10 feet), affecting both those within and without the area (even the caster). All quiet sounds (footfalls, whispers) are automatically silenced. Moderate sounds (normal speaking voices, a creaking door) require a successful Awareness test with a -20 penalty to be heard (CS -40 penalty). Loud noises (shouts, weapon clashes) require a successful Awareness test to be heard (CS -20 penalty).

Listeners outside and within SI × 5 feet of the area hear the muffling hum with a successful Awareness test at a -20 penalty (CS -40 penalty). Even so, they might not understand its significance.

- 7 Casters hear noises as usual; their own noises are still muffled to others.
- 8 Caster may place spell on an object weighing no more than SI × 5 pounds; it may be left behind without disrupting the effect. Object Element modifier (page 201) applies. Range is Touch.
- 9 Caster may designate SI creatures within SI × 5 feet and LOS who, within the area of effect, can hear noises as usual while their own noises are still muffled to others.

## nightmare · iv

The creature touched has frightening, intermittent illusions when awake and disturbing dreams when asleep. The spell imparts Psyche Stress Levels (PSY) equal to half SI (CS SI). A Spirit test by the target modifies the PSY amount:

cf

f

:

+1

s

cs

:

The target acquires the Hallucinatory Indefinite psyche Trait (page 188), and begins the Psyche Stress Recovery routine (page 189). The Indefinite Trait can worsen in both Intensity and Duration, as explained on page 189. If Nightmare is dispelled, or when the spell duration ends, all PSY levels and an Indefinite Trait, Impulse, or Disorder are eliminated. A trait that has progressed to Permanent during recovery before this point does remain-more of a risk with the longer duration of an initial CS Nightmare.

- 7 The illusions become especially vivid: -10 penalty to Will recovery tests.
- 8 Range increases to SI × 10 yards in LOS.
- 9 The illusions become more horrific: Will recovery test penalty worsens to -20.

Time:

## palm · i

Inanimate objects glow a faint crimson in the exact spots where touched by the caster's hand or finger (Object Element modifiers do not apply). This enables the mage to leave drawings or written messages. At spellfire the caster has one minute to make the marks, after which the objects glow for duration. Casual observers must be within 10 feet during the day (100 feet at night) and test Awareness successfully to notice the glow.

- 7 The glow may be made unseen (no Awareness test) to all but Lyahvi or Grey mages and those who know this spell.
- 8 The glow may be made unseen except for SI rounds under specified lighting (such as dusk, at dawn, at full moon).
- 9 The glow may be made unseen to all but SI designated persons.

## passage · v

Talent bonus: Disembodiment

The caster and half Spirit ML pounds of clothing and gear become semi-corporeal. The mage sees, hears, and smells but cannot feel the elements, grasp solid objects, or speak. The caster may pass through any physical substance at a half Move and as Difficult Movement (page 160) but cannot 'fly'. Incanting is not possible. With spellfire CS, Spirit Sensing tests (page 295) are allowed.

Creatures can see the translucent mage in full light but must successfully test Awareness to do so in dimness. Those who occupy the same space as casters may test Empathy to feel their presence.

Fatigue penalty accrued before becoming and while semi-corporeal (and that from spellfire) does apply. The mage may test Dodge to avoid physical attacks-but only enchanted weapons or spells that cause impact have an effect. If so struck, rather than being injured, the mage must successfully test Spirit or Passage ends. Mundane fire/frost have no effect, and impact from falling is halved.

Spells of a mental nature that target the caster, such as Enthral, Panic, or Aural Blast, have their usual effect.

- 7 When occupying the space of a creature, the mage (only) may exude Aberrance 1 (CS 2) at any point of the turn to affect immediately that creature (allowed once per turn per creature per casting).
- 8 With spellfire success (S or CS), the caster may make Spirit Sensing tests.
- 9 The spell can be laid on a willing person the caster touches. Duration is halved.

## pocket · ii

The mage touches an object weighing up to SI pounds and renders it invisible (but still tangible). Object Element modifiers (page 201) apply to the Casting Roll.

- 7 Caster can still see the object.
- 8 Caster may designate SI others touched during casting to be able to see the object.
- 9 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS.

Time:

Duration:

## prism · iii

The caster creates a visual illusion no bigger than SI feet in diameter. After spellfire, the caster may take a 1-turn action to move the illusion in any manner within its diameter of creation. Otherwise, the illusion is still.

Creatures who see the illusion acting strangely make a Reasoning test. If the success level exceeds the Casting Roll (break ties), the creature understands the image as illusory. Any interaction by a creature involving a sense other than sight automatically reveals the illusion. This includes an image of something that routinely makes noise, but does not.

- 7 Illusion may be SI × 2 feet in diameter.
- 8 Illusion may include one subtle or soft noise that would naturally accompany its appearance (for example, the low growl of a wolf, but not a howl).
- 9 Range can be SI × 30 feet out of LOS, provided the caster has once occupied the location in the physical world, or travelled to the spot in the astralscape.

Time:

Range:

SI × 30 feet in LOS

## sound · ii

A single type of sound familiar to the caster emanates from a point within range. Mages know mundane noises appropriate to their background, but might have to test Reasoning or Folklore to verify familiarity (including Survival as a Secondary Modifier to know about rare animal noises). The sound may not be loud or multifaceted, so no roars, trumpet blares, or specific words of a language (but groans and low shouts are allowed). It is constant throughout duration unless cancelled sooner. If concentration is maintained after spellfire, the caster may manipulate the intermittency ( two brief groans are heard six rounds apart ).

- 7 The sound can be loud, for instance a shout, a blaring trumpet, or a roar.
- 8 The caster may create a palette of up to SI different sounds in the same casting.
- 9 The sound can be from the caster's imagination, even unnatural in tone.

## stench · i

A single designated odour is completely masked from creatures without the Scent trait. The immobile effect extends SI × 10 feet from a point touched by the caster.

- 8 The effect is mobile to an object or person.
- 9 The spell also offsets the Scent Index of all creatures within range by half SI.

## tube · v

An object, or part of one, touched by the caster becomes non-corporeal in an area 1 foot wide and SI feet long. Apply Object Element modifiers (page 201) to the Casting Roll. The object is 'not there' in the affected space and is no longer felt. The resulting cavity admits sound, light, and the elements, and even passage.

- 7 The shape doubles in width or length.
- 8 CS can make Duration SI hours.

## unveiling · iii

Talent bonus: Medium True Sight

The caster's elemental object emits a sphere of multicoloured light that reveals to the caster the hazy location of spirits and astrals (page 290). As 1-turn actions throughout duration, the mage may designate one spirit or astral and test Empathy (spell CS +20 bonus): success reveals its True Form to the mage. One such test is allowed per entity per casting.

- 7 Spell also reveals ethereal energy-test Reasoning instead of Empathy to identify.
- 8 Spell reveals the shape and location of a dematerialised entity's body.
- 9 One person touched by the caster also gets to make similarly the EMP/REA tests.

## vapour · vi

Talent bonus: Disembodiment

The caster and half Spirit ML pounds of clothing and gear dematerialise, with the soul remaining dormant. At spellfire the mage accrues fatigue, as usual, but has the option to delay the spell effect of a successful casting (S or CS). Then, as a free action at any point before duration's end, the caster may enact the effect-and suddenly dematerialise.

The caster remains dematerialised for a number of hours based upon the success level and the literal d100 result of the Casting Roll. The GM should roll the ultimate polyhedral die in secret-casters will not know the exact span.

| roll   | success   | critical success   |
|--------|-----------|--------------------|
| 50-95  | d2hours   | d6×10minutes       |
| 30-49  | d6 hours  | d3 hours           |
| 10-29  | d12 hours | d6 hours           |
| 1-9    | d20hours  | d10 hours          |

At the end of this period, the caster makes a Reembodiment Roll (page 298) and appears at a known location specified at spellfire that is within SI × 100 feet of where spellfire took place (CS SI leagues). A 'known' location is a spot in the physical world where the mage has stood or one corresponding to an astral locale the mage has roamed in the spirit world.

After spellfire, but before enacting the delayed effect option, the caster may place one attuned elemental object anywhere. This object must be designated at spellstart; apply Object Element modifiers (page 201) to the Casting Roll. The caster may then choose to reembody within SI feet of the object.

All physical trauma suffered by the caster is arrested at spellfire but returns upon reembodiment.

- 7 Duration becomes SI hours (SI days).
- 8 Period of dematerialisation may be halved if so designated at spellstart.
- 9 Upon reembodiment, all fatigue suffered before spellfire is removed.

Time:

Duration:

SI × 10 minutes (CS SI days)

## view · iii

Talent bonus: Clairvoyance

The caster's gaze telescopes forward to a new location in LOS up to SI × 50 feet away (CS SI × 100 feet). Sight direction remains the same-the mage's 'eyes' may not 'look around' at the new point (but natural peripheral vision still functions). The mage is effectively blinded in the old location where the body remains.

With intervening semi-transparent fog, mist, or smoke, make a d10 roll versus a TN equal to View SI. Succes allows the mage to see clearly at the new location; failure prevents it for the given round.

- 7 Range is doubled. The caster must make a View SR each round to see clearly if the new point is in the doubled range band. A second View SR is required if there is also mist or dust, as above.
- 8 Effect may be laid on one person touched by the caster (who uses View Index in SR).
- 9 Vision may be reset once each turn to 'look around', limited in extent to 90° left or right and 90° up or down.

## voice · ii

The caster's voice changes tone in order to increase one of the five persuasion skills, as chosen at spellfire. For instance, it becomes silkier for Charm or more menacing for Command. For duration, the ML of the designated persuasion skill increases by 20 (CS by 30).

Should the caster fail in an opposed Persuasion test, the target makes an Awareness test to perceive the mage's Voice as illusory (caster persuasion CF +20 bonus). While this does not dispel Voice, such perception does render it ineffective against the target in retests.

- 7 The spell may affect two persuasion skills for duration. The caster may freely switch between the two 'modes'.
- 8 The spell may be laid on a person the caster touches.
- 9 A CS increases duration to SI hours, allowing the bonus to apply also to Intrigue tests in the Conspiracy Routine.

Time:

1 round

Range:

Self

Duration:

SI minutes

## whisper · i

The caster speaks remotely to one person. The message arrives at the target's ear at the same sound level that the caster utters it, so surrounding noise or distractions at the destination (only) might require the target to make an Awareness test to hear it. For instance, a target in the middle of a loud melee would test to hear a message spoken at conversational level, but not a shouted one. The message is limited to a simple command or phrase (SI words) and only the target is able to hear it.

- 7 The message length increases to several phrases (SI × 3 words).
- 8 The sound level of the message can arrive one level higher than how it is spoken: a mutter arrives as a whisper; a whisper arrives at normal conversational level; a normal-level voice arrives as a shout.
- 9 The recipient may be out of LOS and up to SI × 1000 feet away, but must be someone whose True Form the caster has perceived beforehand.

Time:

SI × 100 feet in LOS

Duration:

## wind · vi

Talent bonus: Elemental Air Bolt

When outdoors the caster may increase or decrease Windforce (WF) by 1, as chosen at spellstart (see Weather Lore, page 64). The effect remains localised up to SI × 10 feet around the caster. If increased from WF0, caster selects the direction. If already WF1+, a CS lets the mage change the wind direction up to 60° (one hexside in the Voyage Routine, page 151). While the affected area can drive or protect a single sailing ship (or several small ones), it could not affect a fleet of large vessels.

- 7 The caster may choose once the Maintain casting option after casting the spell. Changes to WF in the second casting may be measured from its level at the end of the first (potentially ±2 from its original).
- 8 The spell may instead be cast to change the wind direction by 60°, or one hexside (CS 120°, or two hexsides).
- 9 The spell may be used indoors, but the duration is SI minutes and its localised effect is impeded by walls and floors.

CHANTRY QUALITY

## the wisdom of sàvôrya

The core principle of Savorya magic is soul-between the hard truth of Lyahvi light and the secret depth of Odivshe oceans. While often thoughtful and dedicated, Savoryan musings can equally turn fanciful and bizarre. HÁCHERDAD

## Compulsion

Whereas Lyahvi illusions (page 231) are spell effects created in the environment external to the targets, affecting their senses, Savorya convocational spell effects of Mind and Emotion manifest internally to the targets, within their personality. To the victim, Savorya compulsion is very real, but, to others unaffected nearby, it is non-existent. Such compulsion is often described as true 'mind control'.

Psychic Bond : the spell effects of Confusion, Obedience, Perspective, Rupture, and Suggestion are so intimate that they form a Psychic Bond between the caster and the target(s). For the duration of a spell with a Psychic Bond, any Shock State inflicted on a target , from a source other than the spell's own effect, is also inflicted on the caster . Thus, Savorya mages must prudently decide when and under what conditions to expose themselves to their own powerful magic when targeting others.

Example : a mage successfully casts Confusion, leaving a target confused, and creating a Psychic Bond, for seven rounds. On the second round of the spell's duration, the target receives an S3 e injury to the abdomen, resulting in a Stunned shock state and a bleeding injury. Because of the Psychic Bond, the mage also becomes Stunned from the target's abdomen injury-but does not suffer the injury or bleeding. Being stunned breaks concentration (page 182), and, since the Confusion spell requires the mage to maintain concentration, the spell ends. Casters such as this one overcome being Stunned normally, by rolling a successful Shock test at the end of their next turn (page 169).

## major sàvôrya chantries

<!-- image -->

## elemental objects

Savoryan elemental objects either keep the mind's eye attentive to thought and perception-such as a headband, turban, or hood-or remind the mage of the true nature of the soul, such as a non-metallic pendant hung over the heart. In either case, accompanying symbols or images are usually abstract and unique in design, representing the discovery of the unknown.

## convocational effects

Below are ten Savorya effects as examples for Spontaneous Casting (page 207).

Aura • Knowledge • Mind • Emotion • Keléstia

- 1 A	subliminal	glimpse	of	the	future	flashes through	the	caster's	mind	(+3	bonus	to	the next	Fate	Roll	made	within	24	hours).
- 2 All	those	nearby	feel	a	sudden	sense	of confidence,	briefly	mitigating	any	fear	or doubt.
- 3 The caster intuits the existence -but not location or details-of the nearest artefact enchantment	within	Savorya	Index	feet.
- 4 The caster fathoms the general Astrological Sunsign season of a single person	nearby	-Lado	would	be	seen	as Winter,	for	instance.
- 5 The	caster	suddenly	and	briefly	expresses a	random	Sunsign	Trait.
- 6 All those near feel a mild tinge of unease towards	the	caster.
- 7 A passion-inducing wave exudes from the caster.	All	nearby	immediately	manifest	or express	one	of	their	Sunsign	Traits.
- 8 A brief feeling of distraught confusion overcomes	everyone	nearby.
- 9 The	caster	has	a	flash	of	insight.	A	Fate	Roll made	for	a	failed	Lore	skill	in	the	next	8 hours	receives	a	+5	bonus.
- 10 A	piece	of	extradimensional	reality	flashes through	the	caster's	mind	(+5	bonus	to next	Spirit	test	within	24	hours).

## aural blast · v

Talent bonus: Elemental Aura Bolt The Aura of a spirit or being within range and LOS is disrupted. Compare spellfire success level with the result of the target's Spirit test (break ties). Targets resist the spell with a victory; otherwise, they suffer according to their entity type:

-  A being in the physical world suffers one level of Aural Shock per star loss.
-  An astral in the spirit world suffers one level of  Aural Shock per star loss and makes a Reembodiment Roll. The soul is dissolved during Aural Shock recovery.
-  A spirit suffers dissolution for one day per star loss.

In order to affect astrals and incorporeal spirits, the caster must be able to perceive the spirit world (such as with the Medium talent) or sense them (see Unveiling, Lyahvi III). Spirits incarnating a form are corporeal, so casters in range target them with LOS just like beings.

- 7 Caster may target all entities within half SI × 5 feet and LOS.
- 8 Caster may exclude up to half SI known entities from Bonus Effect 7.
- 9 For affected targets, increase Aural Shock or Dissolution by 1 (as appropriate).

## candour · i

Talent bonus: Telepathy

The mage receives a +20 bonus to Intrigue in opposed tests to detect lying in one speaker within 10 feet and LOS (CS +30 bonus). The mage must understand the person's language (a translator has no effect). Candour does not help reveal lies uttered by a target affected by the Enigma spell (Odivshe VI).

- 7 With CS the spell affects the mage against any number of targets, one at a time.
- 8 The spell can be laid on a person the caster touches and who remains within 10 feet and the caster's LOS throughout duration.
- 9 If cast on self, the mage may be SI × 5 feet from the speaker. LOS is not required, but Awareness (sound) tests might be, to hear.

## confusion · v

Talent bonus: Enthral Psychic Bond

All creatures within half SI × 5 feet of the caster suffer severe disorientation. Each subject must exceed spellfire success level with a Spirit test to avoid being confused (break ties)-see Action Limits (page 158). Casters must maintain concentration throughout the spell's duration, during which they also have a Psychic Bond (page 237) with all targets. Affected targets may not make a Reaction Roll to break the confusion until after the spell's duration.

- 7 Caster can designate half SI targets as exempt from the effect at spellfire.
- 8 Each time the effect of a Psychic Bond is triggered, the caster may resist its effect in this instance by successfully testing Spirit (Spirit CS severs the Psychic Bond with the given target for duration, although the Confusion continues).
- 9 The caster can move the sphere of effect 5 feet per round as long as its centre remains within SI × 5 feet.

Time:

3 rounds

Range:

Self

Duration:

SI rounds

Confusion example : a mage with Confusion ML81 begins spellstart, choosing the Quicken option to reduce casting Time to two rounds. After two full rounds of concentration, she takes the Incant option to make the Casting Roll a 1-turn action against Confusion EML61. The dice roll is 47-Success (S) with 15 Fatigue accrued (base 5 plus 10 from the spell's CL V).

All creatures within 20 feet of the mage potentially become confused-this includes two allies and three enemies. However, at spellfire, the mage may release her two allies from the effect (Bonus Effect 7).

The three enemy targets each test Spirit to resist: two roll Failures (F) and the other gets a Success (S), with a d100 roll 31. The caster wins the tie break (Casting Roll 47 exceeds 32) so this target is also affected.

As long as the caster concentrates during the 8-round duration, the targets remain confused: they may only Block with readied weapons or Dodge; may not earn TA; and must Pass on their turns. However, any Shock State they suffer during these 8 rounds forces the caster to test Spirit successfully, or also suffer the same Shock State (Bonus Effect 8). A CS on such a Spirit test would make the caster immune to that specific target's Psychic Bond for the rest of the spell's duration.

## diversion · i

One creature suffers -20 penalty (CS -30) to Perception tests and any skill with PER in its Skill Base-see the Skills List table (page 46). If touched at spellfire, the target must successfully test Spirit at the end of duration or suffer its effect for SI more rounds (one time only).

- 7 Spell may affect up to half SI creatures.
- 8 Penalty becomes -30 (CS -50).
- 9 A target touched at spellfire must successfully test Spirit to end the effect. Test once every SI rounds after duration (spell automatically ends in SI minutes).

Time:

1 round

Range:

SI × 20 feet in LOS

Duration:

## enervation · v

The mage inflicts a traumatic shock to the psyche of one creature. The target receives a SHK 7 attack that is modified by a Spirit test (CS -20 penalty) in place of the Shock test that usually modifies Shock Rolls (page 169). In addition to the resulting Shock State (which also uses Spirit tests in place of all mentioned Shock tests), the target accrues 20 (CS 30) weariness fatigue (page 176).

- 7 Range may be an area emanating from the caster out to half SI × 5 feet, affecting the half SI closest creatures within.
- 8 Caster can designate one creature within the area of effect immune to effect.
- 9 A target failing the first Spirit test suffers one (F) or two (CF) Psyche Stress Levels.

Time:

3 rounds

Range:

SI × 5 feet in LOS

Duration:

## enquiry · i

The caster has a symbolic vision about a person whose True Form the mage has perceived (page 209). The spell has no effect on unknowing or unwilling targets whose Spirit test success level exceeds Enquiry's (break ties).

The vision is not literal-it is not clairvoyance. Instead, the caster has a revelatory glimpse into the subject's most essential, present nature , such as an important ambition, a driving personality trait, or a motivating secret, as chosen by the GM. In effect, Enquiry shares with the

caster an obtuse reflection of the subject's soul, obliquely explaining the simple question: ' what of most importance is at the forefront of the subject's mind '? The symbolic vision-sequence is brief, a single 'scene' (see example, below).

An Enquiry CS produces a longer vision, revealing a second 'scene' or piece of information (GM's choice).

Mages may not attempt Enquiry again on the same target until their Enquiry ML improves by at least 1.

- 7 Subject may be any known entity, such as a ghost or demon.
- 8 Subject may be a deceased being whose True Form the mage had seen prior to death. The vision reflects the subject's nature at the moment just before dying.
- 9 If the mage perceives the subject's True Form anew, the spell may target the same subject a second time before Enquiry ML needs to improve.

Time:

10 minutes

Range:

Self

Duration:

Instantaneous

Enquiry Example : the royal court mage Larasa has recently been asked by the King to investigate Duke Manir. Having perceived the duke's True Form (she once secretly cast Insight on him), she targets him in a casting of Enquiry. Enquiry is a success (S), and the duke's Spirit test fails (F). She has a vision:

Duke Manir stands before his nephew holding a lantern. He shutters the bright light, and the young man's anguished face suddenly plunges into darkness. See the example on page 242 for Larasa's response to this vision.

## enrichment · ii

The ML of one of the mage's Arcane Talents, as designated at spellstart, increases by SI × 2 (CS SI ×3). Enrichment does not work on Disembodiment, Healing, or Transference.

- 7 The spell can be laid on a person the caster touches.
- 8 The spell can be used to make a subject other than the caster aware of a dormant talent (page 259 sidebar).
- 9 Spell may be used on Disembodiment, Healing, or Transference with a -20 penalty to the Casting Roll.

## feeling · ii

Talent bonus: Visnomy

The caster selects one of two versions of Feeling at spellfire:

General : the caster senses within range the presence-but not location-of all entities that have an Empathy score (CS reveals the entity type).

Specific : the caster chooses one known spirit or being within range and senses its strongest current emotion, any Sunsign traits, and a general description of its Empathy (CS precise EMP score):

## empathy description

| 1-4   | Unfeeling     |
|-------|---------------|
| 5-8   | Remote        |
| 9-12  | Average       |
| 13-16 | Understanding |
| 17+   | Sensitive     |

A successful Spirit test by the target at spellfire imparts a feeling of unease and distrust (Spirit CS reveals the caster, if in LOS, as the cause of the unease).

- 7 The caster senses the precise location of all entities in the general version.
- 8 Using the specific version, the caster also learns the subject's Psyche traits (CS including Intensity).
- 9 Using the Specific version, the caster also learns the subject's general Morality description (CS precise MOR score).

Time:

1 round

Range:

SI × 5 feet

## fervour · ii

One person acquires any Sunsign trait (page 23) of the caster's choosing. The target resists the effect with a Spirit test success level that exceeds Fervour's (break ties). If already possessed, the trait becomes an Impulse (page 188).

- 7 Caster may instill a Sunsign-like trait, similar in nature but not listed in table.
- 8 Caster may cast Fervour to remove a Sunsign trait. Duration is SI × 10 minutes.
- 9 If caster has perceived the subject's True Form, LOS no longer required. Range is SI  leagues.

Time:

## harmony · i

One person's connection to the cosmic all-to Kelestia -increases. All Fate Rolls receive +10 bonus (CS +20 bonus). Harmony does not work more than once on the same subject for duration.

- 7 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS.
- 8 When cast on self, a successful Fate Roll achieves a CS on a unit die of 1, 5, or 0.
- 9 A successful Fate Roll for any subject achieves a CS on a unit die of 1, 5, or 0.

Time:

1 round

Range:

Self or Touch

Duration:

SI hours

## host · vi

Talent bonus: Medium

The spell summons a Minor Saviris-an Aura Elemental- and binds it to the caster's own Aura to impart guidance and power. At spellfire the caster makes a Spirit Communing test (page 295) with the Saviris. Casters begin with an Unpopular Estrangement. A successful Communing roll grants them the equivalent of an Anima I Ancestor Spirit Power (page 302) in any skill belonging to the group that corresponds to their Primary convocation. However, the number of Mastery Boosts is one less than a shaman would receive.

The granted Spirit Power lasts SI × 5 days-or until cancelled by the caster or dispelled. The mage may benefit from only one Anima Power at the same time. Mages do not become familiar with specific Elementals; each casting effectively summons a new Saviris.

A failed Communing roll does nothing and the elemental departs. On a CF roll, before leaving, the Saviris enters Spirit Conflict (page 296) to dissolve the mage's soul. Since casters still inhabit their body, they gain the Native Soul benefit in the opposed test.

- 7 Caster may host a Substantial Saviris to petition for an Anima II power.
- 8 Caster begins with an Accepted Estrangement with the Saviris.
- 9 Caster may host a Great Saviris to petition for an Anima III power.

## insight · ii

Talent bonus: Visnomy True Sight

The caster perceives the True Form of the target creature and receives a general description of its Aura (CS gives the precise AUR score).

| aura   | description   |
|--------|---------------|
| 1-4    | Mundane       |
| 5-8    | Shallow       |
| 9-12   | Average       |
| 13-16  | Deep          |
| 17+    | Profound      |

A successful Spirit test by the target at spellfire imparts a general feeling of unease (Spirit CS reveals the caster, if in LOS, as the source).

- 7 Range is SI × 5 feet in LOS.
- 8 The caster perceives the target's Arcane Talents and attuned Convocation.
- 9 The caster perceives the Indexes of the target's Talents and Convocations skills.

## key · iv

The caster selects one of two versions at spellstart. Casting Time varies as given.

Reading (2 rounds): the caster may read written works in known languages and scripts at the rate of one page per round (CS tw0 pages)-see Reading (page 83). Once cast, the caster must maintain concentration until the Reading roll is made, at which point the spell ends.

Writing : (10 hours): the spell grants +1 SV (CS +2) to the Writing test of one work the caster then authors and also personally scribes (page 132).

- 7 With the Reading version, caster also gets a +10 bonus to the Language test.
- 8 With the Writing version, caster also reduces the writing Time in half.
- 9 With the Reading version, caster may read a written work in an unknown language or unknown script (but not both). Reading rate is 10 minutes per page; comprehension is only ever limited .

Time:

See above

Range:

Self

Duration:

See above

## link · iv

Talent bonus: Telepathy

The caster creates a telepathic link with one other conscious person touched at spellfire that enables the two to project thoughts back and forth in a shared language like a spoken conversation (page 77). They cannot read each other's minds and can perceive the other only when a thought is consciously 'spoken'. An unwilling subject may resist with a Spirit test that exceeds the caster's spellfire success level (break ties). The caster must keep the subject within SI × 50 feet in LOS or the spell immediately ends.

The communication depth is equal to a spoken conversation, so gleaning hidden motives might require Intrigue or Empathy, as usual, and persuasion skills may be used to affect the exchange.

- 7 LOS no longer required after spellfire.
- 8 Caster need not touch the subject, but merely be within SI × 5 feet in LOS at spellfire to establish the Link.
- 9 Common spoken language is no longer required; thoughts 'translate' at half Native Language Index for mage and target.

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

Touch

Duration:

SI minutes

## missive · iii

Without using any implements, the caster places a visible written message in a known language and script on any unenchanted object touched. After spellfire, it then takes the caster one second per written character to create the message. Its length is only limited by the object, the size and texture of which might also affect its legibility.

- 7 Spell may place the Missive on enchanted objects.
- 8 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS. The mage can see the writing on the object as if it is merely at arm's length.
- 9 The caster may make all or some of the message invisible to all but the caster. Half SI other people whose True Form the mage has perceived may be designated at any point throughout duration as able to see the message.

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

Touch

Duration:

SI days (CS Indefinite)

## obedience · iv

Talent bonus: Enthral Psychic Bond

The caster forces a creature to obey. The target resists the spell with an opposed Spirit test (CS -20 penalty) that beats the casting success level (break ties).

If successful, the mage may spend 1 round concentrating at any time to issue as a free action a single telepathic command to the target still within range and LOS. No common language is needed, but orders that are not instinctual might require beasts to test Creativity to understand (although the mage may attempt such failed commands anew). Targets then act on their own IR. Each command lasts 1 round, so the mage must keep concentrating for longer obedience.

The caster has a Psychic Bond with the target throughout duration (page 237).

- 7 The spell may target a spirit or astral within range the caster is aware of.
- 8 The caster may require the target to test Reasoning at the duration's end. If the REA success level is lower than the spell's (break ties), the subject will not recall being affected by spell.
- 9 Caster may require subject to test Spirit at the duration's end. Failure allows the caster to impart a single action the target must undertake within SI hours (CF within SI days). The psychic bond remains until the end of this period.

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

SI × 5 feet in LOS

Duration:

SI rounds

## panic · iii

Talent bonus: Telepathy

The caster fills a person with abject terror, inducing a Fear Roll (page 187) with ABE 1 (CS half SI). If the caster touches the victim, increase the PSY stress by 1, even when it would not normally occur.

- 7 Area of effect extends from the caster to half SI × 5 feet, affecting the half SI closest creatures within it.
- 8 Caster may exclude up to SI designated creatures from the area of effect.
- 9 The caster may choose a victim's Psyche Trait, if one arises from the Fear Roll.

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

SI × 5 feet in LOS

Instantaneous

## perspective · v

Psychic Bond

The caster touches a creature and experiences its physical senses at a level of the creature's own Awareness skill and Perception attribute. An unwilling target may resist the effect with a Spirit test success level that exceeds Perspective's (break ties). Casters must maintain concentration throughout the spell's duration, during which they also have a Psychic Bond with the target (page 237).

- 7 Range is SI × 10 feet in LOS.
- 8 Spell also acts on the EMP attribute.
- 9 The caster may grant the target the ability to experience the caster's senses. Duration is halved and concentration is required by both parties.

Time:

3 rounds

Range:

Touch

Duration:

SI minutes

## probity · iv

Talent bonus: Enthral

The caster engages one person within 10 feet and LOS in conversation in a shared language in which the mage has at least ML30 (basic complexity). The mage must converse with the target for the full casting Time, so persuasion might be required to do so. Cant and gesture are masked by the exchange itself, so, while the Silent and Still options (page 201) are not available, spell recognition (page 203) is possible only by someone who also knows Probity.

The spell lowers the target's Morality (MOR) score by up to half SI (CS +2), as selected by the caster at spellfire. The target may resist the effect at spellfire with a Spirit test that exceeds the caster's success level (break ties). Whether the spell succeeds or fails, if the Spirit test succeeds, the target feels uneasy (S) or even angry (CS) with the caster.

- 7 The spell may raise the target's MOR by up to half SI (CS +2), as chosen by the caster.
- 8 The target's feeling of unease may only arise from a failed Casting Roll (F or CF).
- 9 If casting Time is 1 hour, the mage may change target MOR by 2 more points.

Time:

10 minutes

Range:

10 feet in LOS

Duration:

## quill · iii

The caster improves once the legibility of any written work by 2 SV (CS 4 SV)-see Scribing (page 83). The caster must have the writing implements appropriate for the work's medium, but does not need to be able to read it (no Script or Language requirement). Casting Time is 10 minutes per page (10 hours per day).

- 7 Legibility improves by 1 additional SV if the caster knowns the script.
- 8 Spell can be cast without appropriate writing implements.
- 9 With writing implements, caster may create an improved copy of the written work concurrent with the casting.

Time:

See above

Range:

Touch

Duration:

Indefinite (Permanent)

## recollection · iv

The caster makes a conscious person remember something about a forgotten subject or event specified by the mage (the memory is moved from the subconscious to the conscious). Unwilling subjects resist with a Spirit test exceeding the spell's success level (break ties).

The subject only recalls details equal to the amount that would have been consciously noticed when the memory was originally made. The target might have to test successfully Reasoning or Awareness to recall minute details.

Even with a successful casting, the mage cannot read the target's mind-the subject either freely shares the recalled memory or must be convinced with another spell or persuasion skill.

At the end of duration, the caster has the option of having the memory return to the subject's subconscious (the memory is forgotten again).

- 7 The spell may instead move a memory that was created in the last SI hours from the conscious to the subconscious (the target 'forgets' it). Duration is Indefinite.
- 8 Spell may be used on an unconscious subject, treated as resisting.
- 9 The caster can read the target's mind concerning the specific memory made conscious (no Persuasion is needed).

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

Touch

Duration:

SI minutes

## rupture · vi

Psychic Bond

The caster ruptures the connection between a target being's personality and body. The target may resist with a Spirit test that exceeds Rupture's success level (break ties). Touching the target brings a -20 penalty to the resistance test.

If affected, the victim's body falls prone. Internal functions and normal perception continue, but subjects may not act, move, speak, drink, or eat. Their soul remains dormant in the spirit world. The caster must stay within SI × 5 feet of the target body or the spell ends.

A target personality inhabiting its soul at or after spellfire cannot attempt Reembodiment (page 298) for duration. Should the spirit journey end before the spell, the personality loses inhabitation of the soul and enters the 'ruptured' status described above. The target then makes the Reembodiment Roll at Rupture's end.

The caster has a Psychic Bond with the target throughout duration (page 237).

- 7 Caster may touch the target's throat to allow the target to speak, drink, or eat for 1 round. Each such 'activation' reduces duration by 1 minute.
- 8 Caster may touch the target's head to allow target to move for 1 round. Each such 'activation' reduces duration by 2 minutes.
- 9 With spellfire CS and an affected target, caster may break the Psychic Bond with a CS Spirit test (one attempt per casting).

Time:

3 rounds

Range:

SI × 5 feet in LOS

Duration:

SI  minutes (CS SI hours)

## sensation · i

The subject's vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch all improve. Perception tests and any skill with PER in its Skill Basesee the Skills List table (page 46)receive +10 bonus (CS +20 bonus).

- 7 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS.
- 8 When caster applies spell to self, bonus is +20 (CS +30).
- 9 Any successful test benefiting from Sensation achieves CS on a units die roll of 1, 5, or 0.

## solace · i

The caster touches a person and designates a single known mental trauma for an immediate Psyche Stress Recovery Roll (CS +20 bonus). The same mage may cast Solace once per trauma per target.

- 7 May be cast to change Initiative or Fear states to Steady. An unwilling subject may resist with a Spirit test success level exceeding Solace's (break ties).
- 8 The Bonus Effect 7 may be cast on up to half SI designated targets within SI × 5 feet and LOS. Unwilling subjects may resist.
- 9 May be cast on a target for an Aural Shock Recovery Roll (CS +20 bonus).

Time:

1 round

Range:

Touch

Duration:

Instantaneous

## suggestion · vi

Talent bonus: Enthral Psychic Bond

The caster seems reasonable to people spoken to in a common language within 10 feet and LOS. The caster may make one suggestion to one person per minute, starting one minute after spellfire, even to different targets, each with different suggestions. The mage's Language Index (page 77) limits the complexity of the suggestion. No Persuasion tests are required for demands that might usually require them ( convincing a guard to allow passage through the gate after dark ).

Extraordinary demands have a chance of working ( convincing a guard to allow passage through the town's sally port during a siege ). Targets resist, and are unaffected for duration, with a Spirit test success level that exceeds Suggestion's (break ties). Only a Spirit CF convinces them to inflict harm against their instinct.

The mage has a Psychic Bond with all affected targets for duration (page 237).

- 7 If touched, the target has a -20 penalty to Spirit test to resist.
- 8 Caster may make the same Suggestion to two different targets at the same time. Doing so 'costs' two duration minutes.
- 9 Effect range can be SI × 10 feet in LOS. Mage can deliver a 'speech', with targets merely listening.

Time:

3 rounds

Range:

Self

Duration:

SI minutes

## thought · ii

Talent bonus: Telepathy

The caster injects a thought into the mind of a person with a shared language. This is not a command ( attack the innkeeper ) but rather a plausible idea about the immediate situation ( the innkeeper short-changed you ). The target then reacts naturally as if convinced of the idea.

Unless willing, the target nullifies the effect with a Spirit test that exceeds the spell's success level (break ties); Spirit CS against Thought Success (S) also imparts a feeling of unease towards the caster.

- 7 Range becomes SI × 10 feet in LOS.
- 8 If Range is Touch, the target has a -20 penalty to the Spirit test to nullify.
- 9 Shared language with target no longer required.

Time:

1 round

Range:

SI feet in LOS

Duration:

Instantaneous

## veil · vi

Talent bonus: Telepathy

Observers perceive the caster and up to half Spirit ML pounds of worn or carried equipment as an ordinary and innocuous element of the inanimate environment ( blending in with a stone wall ). The caster may not move or speak, or the spell ends.

An observer sees through the Veil with a test of either Spirit or Sensitivity that exceeds Veil's success level (break ties). The spell affects the minds of observers; the caster's body is still material and can be discovered through physical contact.

An observer who sees through the Veil may spend 1 round convincing one other observer that the subject is material. The fooled observer may make a second Spirit test once to see through the Veil. If this test fails, the fooled observer remains so for duration.

- 7 The spell can be laid on a creature the caster touches.
- 8 The mage (only) may make a half Move or Grope each turn; each such action reduces duration by 1 minute.
- 9 With concentration the mage (only) may speak without ending the spell, although anyone may hear it.

Time:

3 rounds

Range:

Self

Duration:

SI minutes

## wisdom · iii

The caster selects one of two versions of Wisdom at spellstart:

Expound : the caster meditates on a revelatory scene already produced by the mage's own casting of the spell Enquiry (page 238). Unknowing or unwilling targets may resist the spell with a Spirit test Success Level that exceeds Wisdom's (break ties). This is in addition to the similar test made to resist the initial Enquiry spell.

If Wisdom takes effect, the GM describes again Enquiry's vision, but this time less vaguely and mysteriously, with more insight or overt clues, and perhaps even at more length (see example, below).

Illuminate : the caster attempts to penetrate the Enigma spell (Odivshe VI) that has been cast on a person whose True Form the mage has perceived. If Wisdom's success level exceeds Enigma's (break ties), then Wisdom produces a revelatory vision about the target in the same way Enquiry does.

Regardless of the version used, casters may not attempt Wisdom on the same target until their Wisdom ML improves.

- 7 A Wisdom CS allows the mage's player to ask one follow-up yes-no question after hearing Wisdom's enhanced vision.
- 8 Casting time becomes 10 minutes.
- 9 If the mage perceives the subject's True Form anew, the spell may target the same subject a second time before Wisdom ML needs to improve.

Time:

1 hour

Range:

Self

Duration:

Instantaneous

Wisdom example : an Enquiry spell cast earlier by the mage Larasa imparted the vision of Duke Manir dimming the light of a lantern shining on his nephew. Larasa then casts Wisdom (Expound) and succeeds.

The GM imparts more details to the vision: 'Larasa feels anger swelling inside the Duke and, in turn, fear overcoming the nephew. As the light of the lantern dims, Larasa feels a sudden, sharp pain in her chest and then the vision immediately ceases'.

CHYREFAL

## the quiescence of odívshè

The core principle of Odivshe magic is water-between the profound emotion of Savoryan soul and its natural course through Fyvrian earth. The passions of the Odivshe mage gather slowly, whether expressed as an icy remove or an impenetrable gloom. GÔRIS HÁCHERDAD

## Ethereal Water

Many Odivshe spells enable mages to channel water principle into the physical world. Such ethereal water concurrently exists in both the spirit and physical worlds. It is much easier to walk through than physical water, so even wading through it submerged is treated simply as difficult movement. By the same token, the reduced buoyancy makes swimming much more difficult (-40 penalty). Being trapped in it induces a milder form of asphyxia that doubles the normal trauma periods (page 183). Other Odivshe principles impart unique effects.

Ethereal Cold : targets do not risk frost injury, but a victim affected by ethereal cold for an hour suffers a Cold Hazard check (page 149).

Ethereal Dark : characters shrouded by ethereal darkness in an otherwise lighted environment can see but suffer a-40 penalty to visual Perception and Awareness tests. Natural half-light or shadows become utterly pitch black where ethereal dark overlaps.

Ethereal Gloom : this hybrid of ethereal cold and dark imparts a sluggishness of the former with a dimness of the latter. For its effect, see the Gloomweb spell (page 246).

Ethereal Ice : touching or being touched by ethereal ice inflicts ethereal freeze. The target makes a Shock Roll against a certain Shock State Index (often SHK 7) but suffers no actual frostbite injury-there is no faspect impact and body location is irrelevant.

The caster ascertains the contents of up to half SI pints of liquid as mundane, exotic, or esoteric, as per the distinction on page 265. If mundane, the liquid is also identified ( salt water , spoiled wine ). If the volume consists of several substances, then they separate and may be poured off individually, even if not identified.

- 7 If liquid is exotic, then whether it is herb- or mineral-based is revealed.

## breath · iii

The caster projects a cone of ethereal ice that is five feet wide out to 15 feet away, and 10 feet wide from there to 30 feet away. Creatures caught in the area make a Shock test against SHK 7 (page 169); those in the front half suffer a -20 penalty (Breath CS additional -20 penalty). A fire source reduces SHK by 1 in the area beyond that described by its diameter (page 225), but then is itself snuffed out.

## condensation · iv

When outdoors, the caster creates a one-foot-diameter sphere of cold air and selects one of two effects at spellfire.

Water Trap : atmospheric moisture condenses when it contacts the sphere, dripping in 4 hours a number of pints of water according to climate and SI:

| climate        | pints   |

Rain : precipitation is created in the surrounding region up to half SI leagues away from the sphere. Determine this distance randomly to the nearest mile-for an SI6 or SI7 caster it would be d3 leagues. A d10 roll according to the current temperature determines the type of precipitation created (first column):

| precip type   | frz   | cold   | cool   | wrm   | hot   |

## conjure · vi

The caster summons a Minor Sheor from its primal plane and binds it to at least a five-foot cube host mass within range, such as part of a pond or creek. With spellfire success, the elemental tests Spirit in opposition to the Casting Roll (do not break ties: ).

## opposed conjure-spirit test

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 1 The Shéôr remains bound to its host mass as a free elemental (page	358).	If	possible, it tries	to	flee	the	mage,	attacking	if	necessary.
- The	Shéôr	returns	to	its	primal	plane.
- 1 The	mage	controls	the	Shéôr	for	duration, then	it	returns	to	its	primal	plane.
- 2 The mage controls the Shéôr for double the duration,	then	it	returns	to	its	primal	plane.
- 3 The mage controls the Shéôr for triple the duration.	The	mage	may	then	leave	it	bound to its host mass as a free elemental or allow it	to	return	to	its	primal	plane.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

These results are in addition to those of the Casting Roll table (page 202).

A mage who successfully controls the Sheor may take 1-turn actions starting on the following round to command it to perform any action within its power (page 362). Both the mage's command and the Sheor's action take place on the mage's Initiative Rank (IR).

<!-- image -->

- Caster may conjure a Substantial Sheor into a 10-foot cube host mass.

<!-- image -->

The Sheor has -10 penalty to the opposed Spirit test.

## cooling · i

The mage touches a creature with an extremely cold hand, imparting one of two effects announced at spellstart:

Burn Treatment : a single non-Area burn injury, or instance of heat exposure, is given an immediate Healing Roll (CS +20 bonus). The same trauma may receive only one such roll from Cooling. This roll does not stack with similar rolls from other arcane sources.

Deaden Pain : a Shock State Index of 9 or less is reduced by 1 (CS 2). The effect does not apply to indefinite SHK, such as that suffered from a disease or coma.

- 7 Spell can extinguish fires of Fire Size 0 (candle, lantern) or 1 (torch).
- 8 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS.
- 9 Burn Treatment option may apply to a single Area burn injury.

## crystals · iii

The caster manipulates the already existing precipitation within a radius of SI × 30 feet. The effect remains centred at the point where the caster was at spellfire. The caster selects one of the following two options at spellstart:

Type : the existing form changes to any other type available according to the temperature, such as Cool rain to Cool hail :

| temp     | precipitation types               |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Cool     | Rain • Hail                       |
| Cold     | Hail • Freezing Rain • Sleet•Snow |
| Freezing | Sleet•Snow                        |

Rate : the rate changes up or down one level between 1) none 2) light or 3) continuous (step 3.2, page 144).

- 7 Changes in type may include an adjacent row, such as Snow in Cool Temperature .
- 8 Rates may be changed by two levels.
- 9 Warm (Rain · Hail) is the table's top row.

## dowsing · ii

The caster knows the distance and direction to the nearest body of fresh and potable water within SI leagues above ground, or within SI × 10 feet below ground. Spellfire CS gives approximate volume of the water source.

- 7 Caster may alter the effect to only potable water-based beverages, such as ale or wine, within SI × 10 feet.
- 8 Range increases to SI × 3 leagues.
- 9 Caster may alter the effect to only toxic or poisonous liquid within SI feet.

## enigma · vi

Enigma conceals the caster's True Form, preventing detection by the Enquiry spell (Savorya I) and by esoterica that grant True Sight. Enigma blocks the Wisdom spell (Savorya III) only if its success level exceeds Wisdom's (break ties).

Enigma confuses the results of Insight (Savorya II) and the Visnomy talent, resulting in a response of average or no effect when targeting the Enigma caster.

As a side effect, casters themselves may not make Aura-based tests or inhabit their soul throughout Enigma's duration. If targeted or forced, the caster's Aurabased tests result in CF. At any moment, mages may cancel Enigma, thus allowing for immediate Aura-based tests.

- 7 If Enigma resists a successful Enquiry or Wisdom spell, the mage can describe a fictitious vision that is 'revealed'.
- 8 The spell may be laid on a willing person the caster touches. Only the caster may issue the free action cancellation.
- 9 If cast on self, a CS increases duration to Indefinite. The spell ends only if cancelled by the caster or dispelled.

## floe · vi

A large body of water freezes when touched by the caster. The Floe lasts as long as it would naturally, and it cannot be dispelled, even by the caster. The area and depth affected varies according to the surrounding air temperature and Floe SI:

| temp     | area                | depth          |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Cool     | SI×5 feet diameter  | Half SI inches |
| Cold     | SI×10 feet diameter | SI inches      |
| Freezing | SI×20 feet diameter | SI×2 inches    |

Spellfire	CS:	+2	SI	for	figuring	Area	and	Depth.

For salt water, halve all dimensions. The area fills out the available water's dimensions naturally. Thus, it would likely not be square in a narrow stream.

Here are estimated benchmark icedepths required to support given weights:

| ice   | weight   | ice   | weight   |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| 3"    | 400 lbs  | 6"    | 1800 lbs |
| 4"    | 800 lbs  | 7"    | 2400 lbs |
| 5"    | 1200 lbs | 8"    | 3200 lbs |

- 7 Caster may freely shape the Floe's area, for instance making a path across a river.
- 8 Range becomes SI × 5 feet.
- 9 Casters may recast Floe to 'melt' their own created Floe. It disappears in one round if Cool, two rounds if Cold, and three rounds if Freezing.

## flotation · i

The caster increases the buoyancy of a creature with a Strength of 29 or less by making its liquid content semi-corporeal. The subject increases Swimming ML by 40 on water (but as a concomitant penalty under it). If cast on self, the mage may toggle the effect on and off for duration.

- 7 Swimming ML change becomes ± 50.
- 8 Swimming ML change becomes ± 60.
- 9 Caster may place the ±30 Swimming ML effect on half SI targets.

Time:

1 round

Range:

## freeze · iii

Talent bonus: Elemental Frost Bolt

At spellfire, the caster creates half SI charges (CS SI charges). One charge is expended when the caster's own flesh or elemental focus comes in contact with a creature, who suffers d4 + SI frost impact in the location touched. When an object weighing no more than half the caster's Spirit ML in pounds is similarly touched, a charge is expended and it becomes extremely cold. A creature holding such an object suffers d4 + half SI frost impact to the appropriate location if it is not immediately dropped.

- 7 The caster controls whether the effect manifests at each instance ( friends may be touched without freezing them ).
- 8 Caster can use two charges at one manifestation, increasing impact by 4.
- 9 Range becomes SI × 5 feet. Caster may designate a specific location to freeze.

## gills · iii

The caster can breathe safely under water at the expense of being able to out of water. The mage may share the effect by touching one willing creature at spellfire, but the duration is halved, during which time contact must be maintained or the touched creature loses the effect.

If laid upon a water-breathing creature, Gills has the inverse effect.

- 7 Mage may grant the subject the ability to breathe also in its natural environment.
- 8 May be cast on an unwilling creature, who resists with a Spirit test exceeding Gill's success level (break ties).
- 9 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS for targeting willing creatures (unwilling targets must still be touched).

Time:

## gloomweb · v

The area within SI × 5 feet of the caster is flooded with ethereal gloom. The effect follows the mage's movement. Anyone but the caster within the Gloomweb suffers the following effects:

- Awareness and Perception tests have -40 penalty.
- Movement cost is Difficult, page 160. The gloom has a viscous quality but cannot be swum in like ethereal water.
- Melee strike Impact is reduced by half SI.

Projectiles passing into or through the Gloom, even those originating outside it, have their strike impact reduced by SI.

- 7 Caster may exclude up to SI creatures from the effect by touching them after spellfire.
- 8 After spellfire, the caster may anchor the spell's centre of effect to any designated point touched.
- 9 Caster can cause the Gloomweb to originate from any point within SI × 5 feet and LOS.

## hush · ii

The caster designates an area with a diameter up to SI × 5 feet, centred on a point within range. All noises emanating from or passing through the area are completely silenced. Even shouts and the sounds of clashing weapons do not overcome the area affected. Sounds made by the caster are also silenced.

A keen observer outside the area might notice the Hush with a CS Reasoning test-its pattern of silence can make contextual noises sound strange.

- 7 After spellfire, the caster may concentrate as a 1-round action to move the Hush area five feet.
- 8 The caster's own spellcasting cant can be heard (functions normally) in the area.
- 9 Before spellfire, half SI persons within range may be designated to be able to hear within and through the Hush.

## icewalk · v

A bare foot or hand of the caster that touches water causes it to freeze instantaneously, allowing it to support SI × 50 pounds at once. The ice chunk melts immediately after the body part loses contact with the water.

- 7 The  effect  passes  through  the  subject's clothing (such as a boot or glove).
- 8 Each ice chunk increases to a 5-foot area that lasts SI rounds before melting.

## pall · iv

A cloud of ethereal darkness and ice emanates from the caster's mouth to a radius of SI ×5 feet and up to 10 feet above the ground (it does not pass through physical barriers). The caster may instead centre the Pall in seed water (range is touch). Visibility within it is five feet and wind does not move or modify it. Each round on the caster's turn, immersed creatures other than the caster accrue 5 windedness fatigue and must make a Shock Roll against SHK 6 (CS 10 windedness fatigue and SHK 7). A S or CS on the Shock test also reduces the accrued fatigue for the turn by 5. Once Unconscious (SHK9), targets keep making Shock tests to reduce fatigue.

After spellfire, casters may extend duration by two rounds for each round they maintain concentration. The mage may do so for SI extra rounds, but such concentration must be consecutive from spellfire or the spell will end after the current duration tally. Thus, Pall lasts 7 rounds at spellfire for a mage with SI7. If concentration is maintained for 7 more consecutive rounds (maximum), it lasts 21 rounds (7 original plus 14 extended).

A Pall CS does not add to duration but does induce -20 penalty to Shock Rolls.

- 7 With concentration, the caster can also move Pall along the ground or water at 10 feet per round in LOS.
- 8 Effect may emanate from a point within SI × 5 feet in LOS (SI × 10 from seed water).
- 9 Caster may have Pall form any shape of equal area (height remains the same).

## quenching · i

Dehydration is deferred one day. Quenching creates a supply of ethereal water that postpones the requirement for mundane water. When Quenching ends, the subject receives a +20 bonus to dehydration Recovery Rolls over the next SI days. Quenching may be recast on a target, but the bonus never increases, and the new duration replaces the old one.

- 7 The spell may be laid on a creature the caster touches.
- 8 Spell may be cast on a plant. Range is touch.
- 9 The bonus to dehydration Recovery Rolls becomes +40.

Time:

## rest · v

The metabolism of a willing creature nearly stops, making them immobile with an apparent mass four times normal and a body that feels exceptionally hard. The living entity is unaware of the passage of time and has no perception of the surroundings. Its soul remains dormant.

While in such a stasis, the subject adds SI to Armour Values in all locations and aspects (CS SI × 2). Resistance tests involving physical trauma, such as Bleeding and Shock Rolls, receive a bonus of SI × 5 (CS SI × 10).

- 7 The subject's apparent mass is twice normal to the mage (only).
- 8 The subject's apparent mass is twice normal to others, but normal to the mage.
- 9 May be cast on an unwilling target who resists the effect with a Spirit test success level that exceeds Rest's (break ties).

Time:

4 rounds

Range:

SI × 5 feet

Duration:

SI × 10 minutes (CS SI hours)

## river · v

Throughout casting Time the mage must be standing or be submerged in seed water of at least WS2 (page 243 sidebar)this is called the host mass . At spellfire the caster and up to half Spirit ML pounds of clothing and gear turn into ethereal water. This is called the bound form and has a Trace WS 1 size.

The mage's ethereal water bound form responds to the host mass's natural passage : remaining within the confines of a pond, lake, or man-made structure, like a fountain; but flowing with a stream, river, or sea's current. Such currents are rated by their Current Force (CUR):

|   cur | perround   | perwatch   | sample     |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|
|     0 | 5 feet     | 1 league   | ocean      |
|     1 | 10 feet    | 2 leagues  | tide       |
|     2 | 20 feet    | 4 leagues  | slow river |
|     3 | 30 feet    | 6 leagues  | avg. river |
|     4 | 40 feet    | 8 leagues  | rapids     |

The ethereal-water bound form only follows downhill elevation changes and may even safely cascade over sudden drops, suffering no falling impact. The natural passage lasts a maximum d6 days at a rate of up to half SI × 5 leagues per day, as selected at spellfire (minimum five leagues per day). A spellfire CS allows the caster to select the number of days between one and six instead of rolling.

Throughout duration, the mage is unconscious and the ethereal water bound form remains contiguous. At the end of duration, the caster reassembles and regains consciousness in the host mass. All fatigue accrued before River spellstart is eliminated, but injuries and ailments are not healed, bleeding recommences, and spellfire fatigue is accrued as weariness .

- 7 The spell can be laid on a creature the caster touches. Target may resist with a Spirit success level that exceeds River's (break ties). Duration is SI rounds, but all trauma suffered at spellfire resumes after the spell ends.
- 8 Casters no longer have to be in a host mass at spellfire. Their bound form may move over flat ground at half Move rate, or at full Move downhill. Duration is SI rounds, but all trauma suffered at spellfire resumes after the spell ends.
- 9 If casters retain their bound form in a seed water of at least WS4, then, upon reassembling, all fatigue except weakness and all bleeding are eliminated. Other instances of physical trauma receive one Healing or Course Roll (as applicable). Duration is 4 hours (CS 2 hours).

Time:

3 rounds

Range:

Self

Duration:

d6 days (CS choose 1 to 6 days)

## shadow · ii

A sphere of darkness emanates from the caster or caster's elemental object to a radius of up to SI × 5 feet. Apply Object Element modifier (page 201) to Casting Roll. In poor illumination, the spell creates total darkness. In full daylight, it creates a shadowy gloom that grants +20 bonus to Stealth tests if it intersects an observer's LOS (CS creates total darkness). The caster's perception is unaffected. It may also be cast to neutralise an equivalent light spell.

- 7 Range becomes SI × 5. Caster anchors effect to a point in space in LOS.
- 8 If caster concentrates after spellfire, the Shadow's radius may be adjusted within its limits by up to 10 feet.
- 9 Caster may divide area into up to half SI different points of effect whose total radii do not exceed SI × 5 feet.

Time:

## snowball · vi

The caster creates and throws a palmsized sphere of mundane frost, ice, or ethereal water (designated each time one is created). Up to SI balls may be created and thrown, one at spellfire and then one as a 1-turn action on subsequent rounds. If not thrown, the ball vanishes at the end of the mage's turn. Hurling it tests the higher of Snowball ML or Throwing ML, with a 30-foot base range. The effect of striking a target varies by the type of ball:

Frost spreads over the victim, inflicting d4 + half SI Area Frost impact (CS +3).

Ice in the shape of a hard snowball inflicts d6 + SI Blunt Impact (CS +4) to a single Location (d6 ZD)-and then melts.

Ethereal water covers the body for SI rounds. The target makes a Shock Roll against SHK 6 (CS SHK 7) when first struck and then accrues five fatigue per round thereafter. Reduce SHK by 1 if the target has 20 or more body Zones.

- 7 Base range equals 60 feet.
- 8 Base range equals 90 feet.
- 9 Base range equals 120 feet.

## spoon · i

The caster stirs a water supply with a hand or elemental object and determines whether it is potable (CS also identifies and defines precisely any long-term impurities). Apply Object Element modifier (page 201) to Casting Roll. Spoon does not detect a water's magical danger, only its natural drinkability. If not safe, no specific explanation is given. The amount of water analysed varies according to SI (see the Seed Water table, page 243):

| si   | size   | gal    | example   |
|------|--------|--------|-----------|
| ≤ 6  | scant  | 1      | waterskin |
| 7    | trace  | 50     | keg       |
| 8    | small  | 250    | tun       |
| 9    | medium | 2500   | fountain  |
| 10+  | large  | 12,000 | pool      |

## tide · iv

The caster converts up to SI quarts of mundane water into a 10-foot cube of ethereal water per quart (CS 15-foot cube). The water must be in hand in a container or from seed water within 5 feet. The Tide can be thrown as a 10-foot wide 'hose' or shaped as a proportional 'pond'. Whatever the form, an edge of it must be within range of the caster. Any creature, including the caster, completely submerged by the Tide on a given round begins to suffer drowning (but at half the rate; see Asphyxia, page 183). Submerged creatures must make a Stumble Roll when first struck by the Tide, but they can later 'wade' through the ethereal water as Difficult Movement (page 160).

- 7 Range becomes SI × 5 feet in LOS.
- 8 Caster is immune to drowning in the Tide.
- 9 Caster and up to SI other creatures touched after spellfire are immune to drowning in the Tide.

## the grey mysteries

Neutral magic either draws from a principle that does not belong to one of the six convocations or draws from several different principles at once. The Shek-Pvar currently group Neutral spells into five broad categories for the training of apprentices. HÁCHERDAD

Artefact : spells dealing with the creation of minor and major artefacts. There are three subtypes of Artefact spells-Enchantment (E), Foundation (F), and Volition (V). See the highlighted sections on pages 256-257 for a summary of the steps involved in creating artefacts.

Defence : spells protecting the caster or a subject from arcane energy.

Dimension : spells accessing interworld portals and interdimensionality (see the special note at the bottom of the sidebar).

Identity : spells altering dramatically a being's mind or body (such as shapechanging).

Incantation : spells augmenting the casting of other spells or interacting directly with existing effects.

## Grey Mages

While any convocational Shek-Pvar may learn Neutral spells, only a Grey Mage can invent them. Even though all spells become Neutral for Grey Mages in terms of learning and casting them, they still categorise invented spells according to the six convocations and Neutral magic.

## dimension spell research

Over the centuries, the Shek-Pvar have proceeded with great care when offering assistance to those wishing to learn dimension spells-catastrophic failures in the past have resulted in the literal disappearance of mages. To this end, the Difficulty (DIF) of Survey, Gate, and Vortex are doubled for purposes of spell research, after applying the Resources Modifier in step 2 of the Spell Research Routine (page 205). This increase reflects not only the deeper prudence involved in the research itself, but also the higher political or social effort required to gain the initial approval even to undertake it. The increase applies whether the spell is learned during character generation or the campaign.

Example : a mature Savoryan mage with Pvarism ML84 has three-star Xerium in Hepekeria as a home chantry, which allows optimal access to learn the Gate spell. During character generation, this would cost 14 ARP (CL5 + CD2 = 7 ARP , then doubled).

## absorb · i

Incantation

The spell helps mitigate Arcane Misfire (Spell Misfire, Talent Misfire, Alchemical Dissolution, and Divinatory Blindness). Casters may target themselves or someone they touch. Absorb lies dormant for duration until the subject's next Arcane Misfire Roll (of any type). Once triggered, Absorb reduces the d100 roll by SI × 5 (CS SI × 10), with a modified roll of less than 1 resulting in no misfire effect. A naturally rolled 100 still counts as a 100. The spell ends after duration or after mitigating a single misfire (CS after half SI misfires).

Time:

1 round

Range:

Self or Touch

Duration:

SI hours (CS Indefinite)

## aegis · i

Defence

Aegis helps protect the caster, or someone touched by the caster, from active arcane energy, such as spells, invocations, and elixirs. Aegis gives a half SI × 5 bonus against the next such effect that targets the subject (CS SI × 5). Against spells and invocations, the bonus can apply to the subject's Spirit resistance test or to a Shock Roll-whichever makes more sense for the given effect. With elixirs, the bonus applies either to the subject's Imbibing Roll or to Shock Rolls involving applied elixirs.

Aegis ends after the modifier applies once, or at the end of duration. Multiple instances of Aegis may be cast on the same subject, but their effects manifest sequentially, as cast, against consecutive effects.

Time:

3 rounds

Range:

Self or Touch

Duration:

SI hours

Aegis example : a mage with Aegis ML63 makes a CS Casting Roll, resulting in a +30 bonus when the mage is targeted by the next instance of active arcane energy. For instance:

Breath spell (Odivshe III): the +30 bonus would apply to the mage's Shock Roll resulting from the Area frost impact.

Eruption elixir: the +30 bonus would apply to the mage's Shock Roll resulting from the elixir's Area burns.

Panic spell (Savorya III): the +30 bonus would apply to the mage's Fear Roll (Will test).

## alarm · ii

Artefact (Enchantment)

The mage follows the Minor or Major Artefact Creation Sequence and enchants an object with Alarm . The enchantment raises an alarm when a designated type of spirit or being is within SI × 100 feet of the artefact (CS SI × 300). At spellfire the caster specifies the living entity type and one of three alarm styles:

Glow : the artefact glows a designated colour, the intensity of which reflects the entity's proximity. At its brightest, the artefact sheds coloured light in a 5-foot radius.

Ringing : the artefact makes a ringing noise, the loudness of which reflects the entity's proximity. At its greatest, the sound resembles a loud bell.

Vibration : the artefact vibrates silently, the intensity of which reflects the entity's proximity. At its most vigorous, the artefact visibly shakes.

Once alerted and aware f0r at least one round, an attuned wielder may end the alarm as a free action.

Time:

10 hours

Range:

Touch

Duration:

Continuous artefact effect

## attune · i

Incantation

Talent Bonus: Sensitivity

The caster forms Indefinite attunement with an arcane artefact (page 208). It can be broken by the mage using the Cancel casting option; through contact loss (Attune CS gives +20 bonus to resist contact loss); or by another character casting Dispel (Neutral II).

Time:

1 round

Range:

SI feet in LOS

Duration:

## bane · ii

Artefact (Enchantment)

Mages may only cast Bane in a Major Artefact with Ego Volition and that is already enchanted with their own casting of the Alarm spell (above). Bane increases weapon impact by 2 against the entity designated by the Alarm spell (CS 3).

Time:

10 hours

Range:

Touch

Duration:

Continuous artefact effect

## bubble · vi

Defence

Talent Bonus: Negation

A spherical zone centred on the caster in a radius of half SI × 5 feet automatically disrupts active arcane energy (the same as listed in the Detect spell, page 251). The caster must concentrate throughout duration and may not move. On any turn, the mage may extend the radius of effect to SI × 5 feet for a round, but duration is reduced by one round.

No arcane effect may pass through or work within the Bubble, including the caster's. Existing arcane effects of any duration (even Permanent ones) cease until the end of the Bubble, whereupon they resume if any of their own duration remains. If the caster stops concentrating, the spell ends.

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

Self

Duration:

SI rounds

## chain · iv

Incantation

The caster selects up to half SI spells (even multiples of one) to begin casting in a designated order immediately following Chain's successful spellfire (S or CS). The other spells must each have a casting Time no longer than 10 minutes. Another Chain cannot be one of these other spells.

The caster takes the 1-turn Incant action to make a Casting Roll for each spell at its moment in the Chain. There can be no delay between the spellfire of one spell and the spellstart of the next spell in the chain on the next turn.

The resulting fatigue of each casting is noted (including that of Chain)-but none is accrued until the last spell is cast, whereupon the caster suffers all fatigue at once. Failure to cast Chain itself (F or CF) induces immediate casting fatigue, of course, and thus no actual chaining. Aborting or achieving Casting Roll Failure (F) with any chained spell at its point in the sequence does not affect the rest of the spells in the chain. However, a Casting Roll CF with a chained spell forces the mage to abort all ensuing chained spells, likely with no, or much reduced, fatigue from them (see Abort, page 200).

Detect-Reveal-Dispel is a commonly chosen chain of spells to cast.

Time:

1 turn

Range:

Self

Duration:

Until spellfire of all spells

## charge · ii

Incantation

Throughout casting time the mage touches an attuned artefact with a permanent duration. At spellstart, the caster designates one of the artefact's known latent enchantments. A successful Charge replenishes one of its charges, or five points in a Fount (CS double these amounts). Multiple castings of Charge may replenish an enchantment only up to its maximum amount.

When mages select the Maintain casting option, consecutive castings of Charge on the same enchantment have casting times of one minute.

Only a Grey Mage casting Charge may replenish an Earthmaster object. The caster must first establish concurrence. The maximum amount such an object may hold equals the highest result from its random charges dice array. For example, an object usually found with 2d6 charges can hold at most 12.

Time:

10 minutes

Range:

Touch

Duration:

Instantaneous

## converse · iv

Identity

The caster speaks and understands with Limited fluency (page 77) the native language of one targeted person within 10 feet in LOS (CS Basic fluency). When the caster speaks, the person hears their own language for duration, while those not targeted hear the caster's. The spell does not affect the subject's mind but rather acts as a translation device.

Time:

1 round

Range:

Self

Duration:

SI rounds

## counter · iii

Defence

Talent Bonus: Negation

The caster disrupts a spell being cast by another mage who is using either cant or gesture. If able to perceive this cant or gesture, and not currently taking a multi-round action, the caster makes the Counter casting roll right before the target mage's spellfire. If Counter fails, then casters can still act normally on their next turn. If Counter succeeds, casters must Pass on their next Initiative Rank, as a special recovery.

With a Counter success, the other mage casting the targeted spell continues to its spellfire. If the Counter's success level exceeds the target spell's (break tied successes), the target spell is halted as if the target mage aborted the casting (see Casting Options, page 200).

A mage may cast only once per round Counter, Distort (N-II), or Reverse (N-V).

Time:

See above

Range:

SI × 10 feet in LOS

Duration:

Instantaneous

Counter example : a mage with IR40 and Counter ML77 perceives another Pvarist begin spellstart on IR50 with a spell that has a Free Action casting Time. Even though it is IR50, the mage may first cast Counter-a roll of 31 is a Success (S). The target Pvarist then completes spellfire on IR50. This Casting Roll is a Success (S) with a roll of 58, so the Counter fails and the target Pvarist's spell takes effect. Since the Counter failed, the mage can still take a regular action on IR40 (if Counter had succeeded, the mage would have to Pass).

## detect · i

Incantation

Talent Bonus: Sensitivity

The caster senses all arcane energy within range. There are six types of such energy:

-  Active spells
-  Active talents
-  Artefact enchantments
-  Elixirs
-  Raw Principle
-  Rune Objects

Detect identifies the arcane energy according to the above general categories, but it gives no further details other than their location and source, even if hidden or directly unseen ( there is an elixir and an artefact inside this closed chest ). Detect does not reveal innate arcane power in entities-only whether they are currently affected by arcane energy ( there is an active spell cast on that person standing over there ).

The spell does not detect arcane effects protected with a Ward spell (Neutral II), but the Ward itself would be detected as an active spell and identified as a Ward.

A Detect CS gives the mage +20 bonus to later casting rolls of Attune (Neutral I), Dispel (Neutral II), and Reveal (Neutral I) that target the same source of arcane energy targeted with Detect.

Time:

2 rounds

Range:

SI × 5 feet

Duration:

Instantaneous

## dispel · ii

Defence

Talent Bonus: Negation

The caster targets a specific source of arcane energy that the mage has already successfully targeted with both the Detect (Neutral I) and Reveal (Neutral I) spells. The mage then casts Dispel to end the energy's Temporary or Indefinite effect. Any protecting Ward must first itself be dispelled.

Dispel casting rolls include a penalty according to the type of arcane energy that is targeted:

Active spell : the target spell's Complexity Level ×5 (×10 if it has Indefinite duration).

Active talent : half the Talent Index that invoked the target effect ×5 (×10 if it has Indefinite duration).

Artefact enchantment : the CL of the target enchantment ×10. Active latent enchantments are dispelled as if they were active spells (above).

Elixirs : the elixir's Alchemical Strength (AS) ×5.

Raw Principle

: -60.

Rune object : the Runecraft Index of its creator ×5.

Time:

1 minute

Range:

SI × 5 feet in LOS

Duration:

Instantaneous

## distort · ii

Defence

The caster inserts warped forces into the casting of another mage who is using either cant or gesture. If able to perceive this cant or gesture, and not currently taking a multi-round action, the caster makes the Distort casting roll right before the target mage's spellfire. Distort casting Time-whether the casting roll succeeds or not-is so brief that casters can still act normally on their next turn.

A successful Distort induces Critical Failure and Misfire in the target spell if the units die of the target spell's failed Casting Roll is a 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, or 0 (rather than just the usual 5 or 0).

A CS Distort induces Critical Failure and Misfire on all casting failures of the target spell (F or CF).

A mage may cast only once per round Distort, Counter (N-III), or Reverse (N-V).

## false soul · iii

Artefact (Volition)

The mage follows the Major Artefact Creation Sequence and creates Ego in an object during step 2: Volition (page 257). False Soul imbues the artefact with an Ego of up to SI (CS up to SI+2).

Time:

10 hours

Range:

Duration:

## focus · iii

Artefact (Enchantment)

The mage follows either the Minor or Major Artefact Creation Sequence (pages 256-257) to enchant an elemental object. Focus grants any attuned caster an SI bonus to spellcasting in the Primary convocation of the creator (CS: SI +5 bonus). Half the bonus is also applied to both the relative Secondary convocations.

Alternatively, the caster may create a Neutral Focus that affects only Neutral spells. When created by a Grey Mage, a Neutral Focus affects all spells.

Mages must be in direct skin contact to use a Focus. Bonded attunement gives two advantages: the mage always knows the direction and general distance to the Focus; and the mage may re-enchant even a Permanent Focus. This is usually done when SI improves and the mage desires a more powerful Focus.

Time:

10 hours

Range:

Touch

Duration:

Continuous artefact effect

## fount · iii

Artefact (Enchantment)

The mage follows the Artefact Creation Sequence (pages 256-257), enchanting an object with Fount as a minor or major artefact. A Fount creates SI × 5 points. Anyone attuned and touching the artefact may use the points to pay for fatigue as or after it is accrued ( weariness fatigue costs double the number of points). The Fount has no effect on weakness fatigue.

The enchantment ends when an Indefinite Fount reaches zero points. Mages may cast the Charge spell (Neutral II) to replenish Permanent Founts. They can enchant a major Fount with Resurge (Neutral IV) to have it replenish points on its own.

Time:

## gate · v

Dimension

Talent Bonus: Transference

The caster activates a known fixed Barasi Point filament by selecting one of two options at spellstart: Grasp or Capture. Both take form at spellfire as a hazy ellipse eight feet tall and four feet wide. The Gate hovers one foot off the ground, visible only from the side facing the mage.

Grasp : creatures that fit and step through the Gate are transported to the filament's anchored terminal Barasi Point, arriving at the end of their turn (one creature may pass through per round). Up to half a traveller's own Spirit ML pounds of carried or worn clothing and gear is also transported. The nature and geography of both ends of the filament are usually very similar. A caster who concentrates for a round before stepping through may test Creativity once as a free action. A success gives the mage a general sense of the terminus geography (CRE CS a brief literal glimpse lasting the free action).

Capture : the mage visualises either a known destination in a physical world where the mage has been before, or any spot in a physical world that corresponds to an astral locale once roamed in the spirit world. The mage imprints this destination onto the filament, a sort of 'hijacking' that unanchors its other end and directs it to seek the visualised location. The process is indirect and slow (see page 398 box). The new terminus Barasi Point will be one located closest to the projected destination-but could be many miles from it , as chosen by the GM.

Creatures pass through the Gate like the Grasp version, including the limit on gear but with no optional CRE test. Upon arrival, however, a number of days have passed according to the success level and the literal d100 result of the Casting Roll:

| roll   | s        | cs      |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 70+    | d10 days | 1 day   |
| 30-69  | d12 days | d2days  |
| 10-29  | d20days  | d4days  |
| 1-9    | d30 days | d6 days |

After duration of Capture, the filament vanishes indefinitely -its Barasi Points are no longer detectable or employable (Gate CS filament vanishes for only d100 days).

## imbue · ii

Artefact (Enchantment)

The mage follows the Major Artefact Creation Sequence (page 257) and enchants an artefact with an Arcane Talent. The talent's source may be the caster or anyone the caster touches throughout Imbue's casting.

Attuned artefact invokers express the talent's effect using the Talent Index (TI) of the source. TI also equals the TN of any Passive Triggering d10 roll, which works without invocation (page 160 box). An Imbue CS allows invokers to express a CS talent effect, but only if the artefact's foundational Vessel spell was also a CS.

Time:

10 hours

Range:

Duration:

## investment · v

Artefact (Volition)

The mage follows the Major Artefact Creation Sequence and creates Ego in an object during step 2 Volition (page 257). At spellfire casters invest up to SI points of their own Will, with the artefact receiving 3 Ego for each point invested (CS halve invested Will, round down, for same amount of Ego). Investment does not actually reduce the caster's Will; it just measures how much Ego volition a mage can create. Total investment over several artefacts cannot exceed Will score.

The caster may give the artefact a Morality within three points of the mage's own score, and, if Morality is bestowed, may also give it Purpose (page 257).

The caster may cancel Investment in an artefact that has an Indefinite duration. Doing so recovers the invested Will. If all enchantments in an Indefinite artefact are dispelled, then both its Vessel and Investment spells end, restoring the mage's invested Will.

Investment in a Permanent artefact cannot be dispelled, but neither can the mage recover the invested Will.

Any time someone else other than the caster achieves arcane attunement with an invested artefact, the caster must test Spirit . A failure means the mage suffers a number of Psyche Stress Levels equal to half the Will invested in the artefact, rounded down (Spirit CF: PSY stress equals the full invested Will, minimum 1).

## mask · v

Identity Talent Bonus: Transmutation

Mask changes the appearance of the caster or, with -20 penalty, a person the caster touches. An unwilling target may resist the effect with a Spirit test success level that ties or exceeds Mask's.

Select one of two versions at spellstart.

Imaginary : the caster contrives a unique, fictitious appearance. With a Casting Roll Success (S), the caster tests Creativity (Mask CS: no CRE test required). Any failure results in an intermittent flaw that might reveal itself to a suspicious viewer who succeeds on an Awareness test. The flaw is usually facial, such as inconsistent skin or hair colour, or a subtle ripple or slight droop to a feature.

Duplicated : the spell duplicates the appearance of someone whose True Form the caster has perceived (page 209).

Whether Imaginary or Duplicated, the change in appearance is limited to that of Folk (page 363) and to subtle changes in height and weight. A Mask with a substantial change in stature includes a -20 penalty-and only so long as the Height and Build traits essentially offset. Thus, human to Kuzhai is possible with a -20 penalty; the trade-off between height and weight results in no Strength modification. Radical changes in appearance (human and Nadi, Malakta, or Centaurin) are not even possible.

After spellfire, the transformation takes place gradually over 10 minutes.

At spellfire the mage makes a Casting Roll as usual. However, the spell's effect lies dormant until another spell targets the caster. At that instance, Monitor reveals the Convocation, Complexity Level, and general effect of the triggering spell (' it attempts to read your thoughts '; or ' you're awash in ethereal fire '). Monitor lasts SI × 5 days or until activated once (CS Monitor lasts indefinitely, until activated once).

## personality · vi

Identity or Artefact (Volition)

The caster moves an artificial or natural personality that inhabits one object or body (the source ) to a different object or body (the target ). In doing so, the spell severs the source's Ego/Aura connection to its own object/body and reattaches it to the target object/body. Casters may be a target of their own spell but not a source.

An unwilling source or target may each resist the spell with an Ego / Spirit test success level that ties or exceeds the spell's success level. If resistance fails, or is not given, then the source personality inhabits and controls the target body.

Source : a source object left without a personality is still an object; a source body left without a personality dies . Cultures often proscribe such ruinous magic as immoral 'witchcraft'. The caster has the option to delay the source's death for SI hours. If the caster cancels the spell before this time, then the source Ego/Aura reattaches to its object/body.

Target : failing resistance, a target with its own personality loses control of its body to the now inhabiting source personality. Only when the source vacates does the target regain control. If able, the target personality can 'self-exorcise' the source personality from its body through astral travel and Spirit Conflict. Otherwise, it is mute -still inhabiting its body and perceiving the world but unable to speak or control its body (without such control, spellcasting and invoking is impossible).

No Target option : the caster may instead remove the source personality from its source object/body without reattaching its Ego/Aura to a target object/body.

-  An artefact with an artificial source personality so removed loses all enchantments and becomes an object.
-  A being with a personality so removed becomes a Shade in the spirit world.
-  A spirit with a personality so removed reinhabits its soul in the spirit world. Its soul is then dissolved for d6 days. This is the arcane way to 'exorcise' a spirit from possession of a body.

A natural-personality entity involved in the spell-as caster, source, or targetmust test Will -failure inflicts 2 (F) or 4 (CF) Psyche Stress Levels.

Exorcism : an unwanted spirit is expelled from a possessed body.

Golem : the natural personality of an intelligent and seasoned warrior is moved into a large construct with arms and legs. Though lacking true Melee skill, it wreaks havoc through press attacks and trampling.

Mindless warrior : the Ego, low Morality, and bloodthirsty Purpose of a major artefact is moved into the body of a trained warrior. What it lacks in subtlety it makes up for in skill and unshakeable resolve.

## pool · iii

Identity

The total current fatigue of the caster and up to SI other designated participants is distributed throughout the entire group (CS the caster's portion is halved). A participant may be a creature or even a rechargeable Fount, but any unwilling source may test Ego or Spirit to resist the effect by exceeding Pool's spellfire success level (break ties).

If cast at a distance, duration is Instantaneous. If all participants remain touching, then duration is Indefinite -until touch is broken or one of the participants becomes unconscious.

Whenever the Fount's points are reduced, Resurge automatically activates and begins to recover 10 points per hour until the artefact's capacity is reached. The recovery happens whether the artefact is held by or attuned with anyone. Resurge then lies dormant until needed.

## reveal · i

Incantation

The spell can be targeted at a source of arcane energy that the caster has already successfully targeted with the Detect spell (Neutral I). Any protecting Wards must first be dispelled. A successful Reveal gives information according to the target energy (a CS gives more specifics):

Active spell : Convocation, Complexity Level, and general spell effect (CS: precise spell effects-this enables the caster to enter unassisted spell research to learn the spell).

Active talent : the talent's general effect and the Talent Index of the source (CS: the talent's precise effects).

Artefact enchantment : whether each enchantment is continuous or latent; enchantment Convocation and Complexity Level; whether activation requires attunement and/or a key word, or uses charges; (CS: artefact duration, enchantment effects, the exact key word, and current number of charges).

Elixirs : associated principle and Alchemical Strength; this is, by default, enough information to reveal the name-and, thus, effect-of one of the 32 canonical elixirs (CS: Alchemical Strength; elixir effect of a unique elixir).

## reverse · v

Defence

Reverse makes another mage who is casting a spell the target of that very spell. If able to perceive the target mage's cant or gesture, and not currently taking a multi-round action, the caster makes the Reverse roll at the target mage's spellfire. Attempting Reverse requires casters to Pass on their next Initiative Rank.

If the Reverse success level exceeds the target mage's successful casting roll (break ties), the opposing mage becomes the target of the spell's effect. If the target mage's casting roll fails, then a successful Reverse has no effect.

If the target spell has a radius of effect, the spell is centred on the target mage. If it has a cone of effect, it includes the target mage at its start and radiates directly away from the caster of Reverse.

A mage may cast only once per round Reverse, Counter (N-III), or Distort (N-II).

## sanctum · iv

Incantation

The caster infuses an area with the principle of the caster's convocation, giving it a modifier equal to SI × 2 (CS SI × 3). The space has a maximum volume of SI × 125 cubic feet (equal to SI fivefoot cubes). Its nature must reflect the convocational element: an area around a tree, for example, could be a Fyvrian Sanctum. Once cast, a Sanctum prevents other Sanctums from affecting any part of its area for duration or until dispelled.

Spells cast by anyone within the Sanctum are affected by its modifier. The modifier is a bonus or penalty according to how many steps on the Pvaric Wheel the spell's convocation is from Sanctum's:

| stepsaway          | modifier     |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Sameconvocation    | Full bonus   |
| Oneconvocation     | Half bonus   |
| Twoconvocations    | Half penalty |

## subvert · iv

Incantation

The caster targets a major artefact that has Ego (after dispelling any Ward). If Subvert succeeds, the artefact makes an Ego test in opposition. For each star loss (break ties), the artefact suffers one level of Ego Subversion . If so, its enchantments become dormant, unable to be invoked or take effect (even continuous ones). The artefact makes an Ego test at the end of each subsequent turn of the caster's. A success eliminates 1 (S) or 2 (CS) Subversion levels. A CF means it must skip its next test. When Subversion is 0 or less, the spell effect ends.

At spellfire, the mage ignores windedness and weariness fatigue, including that just accrued from casting Tap. After duration, the mage then regains twice their amounts (CS 150% their amounts, rounded down to nearest five). New Fatigue after spellfire applies normally.

The subject of the spell may instead be a person targeted within range and LOS. Unwilling subjects resist with a Spirit test success level exceeding Tap's (break ties).

## trigger · iii

Incantation

The mage targets a latent effect spell that has been personally enchanted in an artefact through Vessel (Neutral IV). The caster describes circumstances under which the spell will fire once on its own, such as at sunset ; or when the artefact is targeted by other magic ; or when the door nearest the artefact opens. The latent spell has its regular success level (step 3, page 256). Trigger ends when it triggers or when it or its target spell is dispelled.

## vessel · iv

Artefact (Foundation)

The mage casts Vessel to prepare an object for enchantment as either a minor or major artefact. Vessel is not the enchantment but rather the arcane foundation that makes it possible.

Vessel casting time varies according to how the mage acquires the object. See Artefact Creation Sequence, step 1, for further explanation (pages 256-257):

| object             | casting time               |
|--------------------|----------------------------|
| Obtained           | 10 days (10 hours per day) |
| Crafted in consort | 15 days (10 hours per day) |
| Crafted            | 20 days (10 hours per day) |

The mage spends 10 hours each day incrementally casting Vessel throughout the entire time. The 10 hours on a given day must be fairly consecutive, with no more than a few minutes each hour for breaks; and the total days of casting time must be in a row-any interruption forces the mage to abort Vessel (page 200). The Spellcasting Roll is made at the end of the last day of casting time.

A successful Vessel cast on an obtained object creates an Indefinite artefact. On an object crafted or crafted in consort , the mage may select either an Indefinite or Permanent artefact duration. In all cases, the mage now has bonded attunement with the object and may begin enchanting it with spells. A Vessel CS allows the artefact to receive CS spell enchantments in step 3.

An Indefinite Vessel ends only when its Indefinite enchantments are dispelled.

## vortex · vi

Dimension

Talent Bonus: Transference

The caster imports to a designated point within range an interdimensional force of pure chaos that seeks out arcane energy. The incorporeal Vortex has a 5-foot diameter (CS  15-foot) and a roaming range anywhere completely within SI × 10 feet from its importation point. Whether the Casting Roll succeeds or fails, the mage accrues all fatigue as weariness .

At spellfire, and each round thereafter at the end of the caster's turn, the Vortex centres itself on a source of arcane energy within its roaming range. These are the same six categories used for the Detect/ Reveal/Dispel spells (and listed below).

With several possible targets, select the source randomly. Casters can 'hide' sources on or affecting their person from being targeted by the Vortex for a round by continuing to concentrate after spellfire, or doing so as a 1-round action on any later turn.

Movement to reach a new source is instantaneous at the end of the caster's turn-the Vortex does not actually traverse intervening space but simply appears at the new destination. If there is no source of arcane energy within its roaming range, then it does not move.

Once the Vortex settles on a point, a test is made against a special ML for all sources of arcane energy within its radius, not merely the centred source. Compute the special ML for each source according to its type of arcane energy.

Active spell : the target spell's Complexity Level ×5 (×10 if it has an Indefinite or Permanent duration).

Active talent : half the Talent Index that invoked the target effect ×5 (×10 if it has Indefinite duration).

Artefact enchantment : the CL of the target enchantment ×10. Active latent enchantments are affected as if they were active spells (above).

Elixirs : the elixir's current Alchemical Strength (AS) ×5.

Raw Principle : ML60.

Rune object : the Runecraft SI of its creator ×5.

An arcane source whose test fails is dispelled for d20 rounds (F) or d20 hours (CF). With success, the source is immune to the Vortex's effect for one round (CS caster also suffers PSY1 stress). Ward spells must be dispelled first before their protected arcane energy can be dispelled, as usual (see Ward spell, below).

There is no limit to the number of sources the Vortex may affect each round. It grows 5 feet in radius each turn it dispels one or more arcane energy sources, up to a maximum size equal to its roaming range.

1 minute

Range:

SI × 5 feet in LOS

Duration:

## ward · ii

Incantation

The mage places a Ward on one source of arcane energy-an active spell or talent, a specific artefact enchantment, an elixir, or a rune object. Because Ward has a 10 minute casting time, some sources might not last long enough to receive a Ward.

A Ward has a Ward Level (WL) of half SI (CS +2). The spells Detect, Dispel, and Reveal have no effect on the protected source until the Ward is dispelled. The WL serves in place of CL when Ward itself resists a Dispel (Neutral II). That is, as an active Indefinite spell, Ward imparts a dispel penalty equal to WL × 10.

Wards have an Indefinite durationuntil dispelled or until a Ward with a higher WL is cast on the same source as one with a lower WL. A Ward on an active spell or talent also ends when the spell or talent ends.

## well · iv

Identity

The caster designates up to SI creatures within range. Each target tests Spirit to resist accruing windedness fatigue (CS -20 penalty):

## minor artefact creation sequence

Mages	follow	these	steps	to	create	an	artefact	that	has	one	enchantment	and	weighs	no	more	than	half	the	mage's	Spirit	ML	in	pounds.

## object

The	mage	acquires	the	object	to	enchant:	it	can	be	obtained,	crafted in	consort,	or	crafted.	The	object	must	have	at	least	a	one-star	quality.

## obtained

Before	the	creation	sequence	the	mage	acquires	an	object	already made	by	a	crafter.	This	character's	craft	Success	Value	test	determines the	object's	star	quality	(page	61).

## crafted in consort

The	mage	uses	an	object	made	simultaneously	by	a	crafter	during	the casting	of	Vessel	in	step	2	(below).	The	mage	and	crafter	must	both remain within 10 feet of the object throughout both the casting of Vessel	and	the	crafting	of	the	object.	The	crafter's	Success	Value	test determines	the	object's	quality.

## crafted

The	mage	personally	crafts	the	object	while	casting	Vessel	in	step	2. The	mage's	craft	Success	Value	test	determines	its	quality.

<!-- image -->

## vessel

The	mage	casts	the	Vessel	spell	(Neutral	IV)	in	order	to	prepare	the object	for	enchantment.	If	successful,	proceed	to	step	3;	otherwise, the	mage	must	repeat	the	casting.

Crafting :	on	a	failed	casting,	a	crafted	or	crafted-in-consort	object	can only	be	used	as	an	obtained	object	in	a	recasting.

## artefact duration

If	the	object	was	obtained,	then	a	successful	Vessel	casting	creates an Indefinite artefact.	If	the	object	was	crafted	or	crafted	in	consort, then	a	success	allows	the	mage	to	select	at	spellfire	whether	it	is	an Indefinite or Permanent artefact	(see	step	6).

## bonded attunement

A	mage	who	successfully	casts	Vessel	gains	bonded	attunement	with the	object	(page	208),	no	matter	how	it	is	crafted.

## 3 enchantment

<!-- image -->

While	touching	the	object,	the	mage	casts one spell using the Spellcasting	Routine.	Add	two	special	modifiers	to	the	test:

## object element

Apply	an	Object	Element	modifier	(page	201	sidebar),	derived	from the	Convocation	Affinity	(pages	195)	between	the spell and the object . Neutral	spells	have	a	0	modifier	with	all	objects.

p +0

s -10

## object quality

Apply	a	modifier	derived	from	the	Star	Quality	of	the	object,	as determined	in	step	1.	Include	an	additional	-10	penalty	if	the	object was obtained ;	or	-5	penalty	if crafted	in	consort :

5 +10

4

+5

3 0

2 -10

1 -20

A	spell	successfully	cast	on	the	object	becomes	an enchantment .	With a	failure,	the	mage	must	repeat	the	casting	until	successful.

If	the	mage	achieved	a	CS	when	casting	the	spell,	the	usual enhanced	effects	apply	only	if	the	foundational	Vessel	spell	in	step 2	was	also	a	CS.	Otherwise,	the	enchantment	is	based	upon	the	spell effects	of	a	success	(S).

n -15

t -20

d -30

<!-- image -->

## effect

The enchantment has either a continuous or a latent effect.

## continuous effect

An enchantment with the phrase Continuous	artefact	effect in the Duration	section	of	its	spell	description	is	always	active.	Some enchantments	might	also	require	the	user's	attunement	(page	208).

## latent effect

All	other	enchantments	have	a	latent	effect.	They	require invocation by	the	user	to	take	effect.

Charges :	the	artefact	carries	1	charge	of	the	latent	enchantment. The	mage	may	increase	this	amount	up	to	Spell	Index × 3	maximum charges,	but	installing	Spell	Index	amount	of	charges	takes 20 days (obtained object); 15 days (crafted	in	consort);	or 10 days (crafted). There	is	no	test	to	install	the	charges-the	mage	simply	spends	the time	doing	so	before	proceeding	to	step	5.

## 5 invocation

<!-- image -->

The mage decides how a latent	effect is	activated.	Such	activation	is called artefact invocation (and	the	person	doing	so	is	the	invoker).

## attunement

The	mage	can	decide	that	the	invoker	must	first	establish	artefact attunement before	invocation	is	possible.

## key word &amp; triggers

If	the	mage	decides	not	to	require	attunement,	then	Minor	artefact invocation relies on a key word ,	a	special	utterance	invented	by	the mage	that	the	invoker	speaks	aloud.

In	either	case,	while	touching	the	object,	an	invoker	not	suffering from	Aural	Shock	simply	takes	a	1-turn	action	to	activate	the enchantment	at	the	success	level	determined	in	step	3.	There	is	no test	and	no	fatigue	accrual.	Invocation	expends	one	charge.

## 6 duration

<!-- image -->

The artefact duration established in step 2 implies the following:

## indefinite artefact

Dispel :	whether	continuous	or	latent,	the	enchantment	can	be dispelled.	If	so,	the	Vessel	spell	ends.

Charges :	after	the	last	charge	is	expended,	the	Vessel	spell	ends	once the	resulting	latent	effect	is	over.

Cancel: the	mage	may	cancel	the	enchantment	(page	200).	The Vessel	spell	remains,	and	the	mage	may	enchant	it	with	any	spell	as an	obtained	object,	starting	at	step	3.

## permanent artefact

Dispel :	the	enchantment	cannot	be	dispelled	from	the	artefact,	but an	active,	latent	effect-if	it	lasts	long	enough-could	be	dispelled until	invoked	again.

Charges :	any	mage	can	cast	the	Charge	spell	(Neutral	II)	to	recharge	a latent	enchantment	in	a	permanent	artefact.

<!-- image -->

## incantations

The	mage	may	place	a	Trigger	(Neutral	III)	and/or	a	Ward	(Neutral	II) on	the	enchantment.	These	spells	are	not	enchantments	but	rather incantations	placed	on	enchantments.	Triggers	and	Wards	have Indefinite	durations;	the	mage	can	cast,	cancel,	and	recast	themand	others	may	attempt	to	dispel	them-at	any	time.

## major artefact creation sequence

Mages	follow	these	steps	to	create	an	artefact	that	has	two	or	more	enchantments	and	weighs	no	more	than	half	the	mage's	Spirit	ML	in	pounds.

<!-- image -->

## object

Same	as	for	minor	artefacts	(step	1,	page	256).

<!-- image -->

## vessel

Same	as	for	minor	artefacts	(step	2).	Once	Vessel	is	successfully	cast, the mage then gives the object volition .

## volition

Volition	comes	in	the	form	of	either Ego (artificial	personality)	or Will (natural	personality).	The	mage	casts	one	of	three	spells	to	give	the object volition , recasting until successful:

## false soul (neutral iii)

The mage gives the artefact an Ego of up to False Soul SI (CS up to SI + 2).	Ego	is	the	only	Personality	characteristic	the	artefact	has.

## investment (neutral v)

The	artefact	gets	3	Ego	for	every	1	Will	the	mage	invests.	Mages	may give	the	artefact	a	Morality	within	3	points	of	theirs.	If	given	Morality, it	may	also	be	given	Purpose	(sidebar).

## personality (neutral vi)

The	object	receives	all	the	Personality	scores	and	traits	of	the	spell's entity	source,	including	its	Ego	or	Will	(as	applicable),	as	well	as	its Morality	and	Purpose	(if	it	has	them).

Complete	steps	3-4	for	each	enchantment	before	moving	to	step	5.

<!-- image -->

## enchantments

Same	as	for	minor	artefacts	(step	3),	plus:

## volition cost

Each	enchantment	requires	an	amount	of	Volition	equal	to	the enchantment	spell's	Complexity	Level	(CL).	The	total	CL	of	all	the enchantments	cannot	exceed	the	artefact's	Volition,	which	equals either	Ego	or	Will,		as	determined	in	step	2.

<!-- image -->

## effect

Same as for minor artefacts (step	4),	except:

Charges : a major artefact carries no charges .	The	artefact's	Volition powers	the	effect	of	all	its	latent	enchantments.

<!-- image -->

## 5 invocation

Latent	enchantments	of	major	artefacts	always	require	invokers	first to	establish	arcane	attunement	(page	208).	Key	word	invocation	is not	an	option.	When	touching	the	artefact,	the	attuned	may	then invoke	a	latent	enchantment	by	taking	a	1-turn	action	to	test Spirit .

Volition :	adjust	EML	by	the	artefact's	Ego	or	Will	secondary	modifier.

## major artefact invocation roll

|    | invoker spirit+volition secondary modifier test                                                       |   fatigue |
|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| cf | Invocation fails. Invoker suffers a numberofAural Shock levels equal to half the artefact's Volition. |        10 |
| f  | Invocation fails.                                                                                     |         5 |
| s  | Invocation succeeds.                                                                                  |         5 |
| cs | Invocation succeeds.                                                                                  |         0 |

If	invoked,	the	enchantment	has	the	success	level	as	determined	in step	3.	The	invoker	accrues	fatigue	as	windedness	(page	176).

<!-- image -->

## duration

The artefact duration established in step 2 implies the following:

## indefinite artefact

Dispel :	both	continuous	and	latent	enchantments	can	be	dispelled, but	each	must	be	targeted	separately.	The	foundational	Vessel	spell ends	only	when	the	last	enchantment	is	dispelled.

Cancel: the	mage	may cancel any	enchantment	and	re-enchant	it	with another	spell	(step	3).	The	Vessel	and	volition	spells	remain,	and	the mage	may	enchant	the	artefact	with	any	spell	as	an	obtained	object, starting	at	step	3.

## permanent artefact

Dispel :	enchantments	cannot	be	dispelled,	but	their	active,	latent effects-if	long	enough-could	be	dispelled	until	invoked	again.

<!-- image -->

## incantations

Same	as	for	minor	artefacts	(step	7)	except	each	enchantment	must be	targeted	separately	with	its	own	Trigger	and/or	Ward.

a

## morality &amp; purpose

Some	major	artefacts	have	Morality	and	Purpose.	Those	created with the Personality spell	automatically	have	the	Morality	and Purpose	of	the	source	personality.	Those	created	with	the Investment spell	might	have	them,	as	decided	by	the	caster:

## invested morality

- The	artefact's	Morality	must	be	within	3	points	of	the	Morality of	the	mage	who	created	it.	A	mage	with	MOR14	who	gives	an artefact	Morality	could	instill	a	score	from	11	to	17.
- An	artefact	with	Morality	risks	inducing	an Antipathetic Reaction (page	208)	in	an	attuner	who	has	Morality	at	least	6 points	different	from	the	artefact's.

## invested purpose

- The	artefact	must	have	Morality	in	order	to	have	Purpose.
- A	mage	giving	an	artefact	Purpose	must	fully	describe	it	in step	2	before	casting	the	enchantments	in	step	3.
- Purpose could be just a single word ( vengeful ),	similar	to	the adjectives	used	to	describe	sunsign	traits-or	even	simply be a sunsign trait ( reckless ).	It	could	be	a	slogan	or	full	phrase ( defend the honour of the clan ; spread the gospel of Ilvir ),	or something	more	detailed.
- The	lower	the	artefact's	Ego	or	Will,	the	simpler	the	Purpose. With	a	Volition	of	10	or	greater,	the	artefact's	Purpose	could	be as	intricate	as	a	player	character's.	See	the	description	of	the major artefact Ilpylen Reaver for	an	example	(page	258).
- Artefacts	with	Purpose	might	be	able	to	'inflict'	attunement	on someone who touches it (see Forced Attunement ,	page	209).
- An artefact with Purpose can initiate Artefact Domination against	an	attuned	person	in	contact	with	it	(page	209).	This occurs	when	the	person's	actions	clash	with	the	artefact's Purpose.	Characters	have	some	control	over	triggering	thisand	even	resisting	it	when	it	does	occur.	However,	failing	to do	so	inflicts	Psyche	Stress,	which	can	intensify	throughout	a long-term	struggle	against	the	artefact's	Purpose.

## brôvin's fount

The	Savoryan	mage	Brovin	wishes	to enchant	an	object	with	Fount	(Neutral	III). He	obtains	a	finely	made	headband	from a	local	clothier.	Although	expensive	(80d), the	silk	wrap	is	exceptionally	crafted	to	four stars,	determined	by	a	Success	Value	test against	the	crafter's	ML81	(SI8 + 0 = SV8).

Brovin	takes	10	days	to	cast	the	Vessel spell	since	the	object	was	obtained.	He has	Vessel	ML72	and	no	modifiers.	The Spellcasting	Roll	is	03	(S),	so	he	accrues 10	fatigue	from	this	CL	IV	spell,	although he	quickly	recovers	from	it.	Brovin	has completed	steps	1-2	and	has	bonded attunement	with	the	headband,	an Indefinite	minor	artefact.

## enchantment

Proceeding	to	step	3	on	day	11,	Brovin spends 10 hours enchanting the headband with	the	Fount	spell	(Neutral	III).	His	Fount ML74	is	adjusted	by	a	zero	object	element modifier	(Neutral	spell	cast	on	any	object); and	a	net	-5	penalty	from	object	quality (+5	as	four-star	object;	-10	from	obtained). Against	a	final	EML69,	the	Spellcasting Roll	is	70	(CF).	This	results	in	15	fatigue	and Spell	Misfire:	a	d100	roll	of	38	brings	about Distortion.	Brovin	suffers	PSY	1	and	warpage to	Aura-based	tests.	He	decides	to	hold	off on recasting Fount until he recovers from the	stress	(he	also	rolled	an	Angry	psyche trait!).	The	first	Will	recovery	test	takes place	d6	days	later:	four	days.	His	Will	ML70 test	is	49	(S),	so	he	overcomes	the	PSY	1 and	distortion	warpage.	He	also	had	long recovered	from	the	15	windedness	fatigue.

Returning	to	the	artefact	creation	on	day 16,	Brovin	spends	10	hours	to	recast	Fount and	rolls	19	(S).	He	accrues	5	fatigue	and enchants	the	headband	with	Fount.

## effect &amp; duration

As	noted	in	its	spell	description,	Fount	is	a continuous	effect	and	requires	attunement to	access	its	35	points	(Fount	SI7 × 5).	As	its creator,	Brovin	has	bonded	attunement, so	he	may	immediately	begin	spending the points to replace windedness fatigue (or weariness fatigue	at	twice	the	cost).

As	an	Indefinite	minor	artefact,	Brovin's headband Fount becomes unenchanted when	its	last	point	has	been	used.	With an	Indefinite	duration,	the	artefact	can be	dispelled	but	cannot	be	recharged. Its	16	days	to	make	was	fairly	quick,	even including	the	four	days	of	Psyche	Stress Recovery.	For	now,	Brovin	places	no	Ward	on the	Fount	enchantment.

## ilp´ylen reaver

A Jmorvian mage-priest of Agrik named Laena was commissioned over two hundred years ago to construct a holy sword for an upcoming Feast of	Balefire.	The	weapon	would	be	awarded	to the winner of the most prestigious gladiatorial combat of the festival's Pamesani Games.

Laena	crafts	herself	the	bastard	sword used	for	the	major	artefact.	The	final	20	days of its forging are subsumed within the 20 days	to	cast	Vessel.	Laena	has	a	Weaponcraft ML70	with	a	+25	bonus	from	the	Secondary Modifiers.	The	d100	roll	is	14,	a	success giving	an	SV7	(three-star	quality).	Using	the five-star	workshop	at	her	temple-fortress, the	SV7	allows	three	d10	Masterwork	Rolls against	TN5.	Results	of	5,	3,and	1	give	the sword	WQ	+2	and	Impact	+1.

Laena	has	Vessel	spell	ML70	and	rolls 65	(CS).	This	allows	the	artefact	to	receive CS Spellcasting Rolls for the enchantments later	in	step	3.	Fatigue	accrual	is	ignored	in this	example	(Brôvin's	Fount	demonstrates how	easily	spellcasting	fatigue	is	mitigated during	the	long	creation	process).

Laena	installs	Volition	in	the	sword	by spending	five	days	to	cast	Investment.	She invests	five	Will	to	give	the	sword	an	Ego	15. Against	Investment	EML68,	the	casting	roll is	40	(CS).	This	reduces	her	WIL-investment to	two.	She	decides	to	give	the	enchantment a Permanent duration and the sword a MOR6	(Unscrupulous),	within	three	of her	MOR9.	With	much	guidance	from	the temple	High	Priest,	the	sword	is	named Ilpylen	Reaver	and	given	a	Purpose:

Bellicose : to make war with all who oppose Agrik, the Immortal Warlord of Balgashang; to seek glory in the arena; to destroy Ivashu.

## enchantments

On	day	26,	Laena	begins	steps	3-4	with	five enchantments.	Their	total	Complexity	Levels (CL)	cannot	exceed	the	sword's	Ego	15.

- Anvil (CL3):	a	+0	object	element	modifier and	her	+7	Jmorvi	focus	increase	her ML89	to	EML96	(maximum	EML95).	She takes	10	hours	to	cast	and	a	35	is	rolled (CS),	enchanting	Reaver	with	+3	impact continuous	effect	(page	220).

Charm (CL3):	against	an	identical	EML95, the	first	casting	is	59	(S).	However,	since her	CS	Vessel	allows	for	CS	enchantments, she Cancels this spellcasting and tries again.	Two	days	later	she	achieves	the CS	she	wants.	With	an	SI8,	Laena	applies the	bonus	effect	that	gives	the	sword	a +15	bonus	(page	221),	another	continuous effect.	Thus	ends	day	29.

- Alarm (CL2): with no object element modifier	from	the	Neutral	spell,	the casting	is	against	her	ML72.	On	the	third attempt,	she	rolls	80	(CF)	and	suffers	a Distortion	spell	misfire.	While	recovering from	the	accompanying	PSY	1,	she acquires	a	permanent	Hallucinatory psyche	trait.	After	taking	12	days	to	recover, she	returns	to	casting	and	finally	rolls	36 (S)	and	decides	to	accept	it	on	day	46.	As	a continuous	effect,	the	sword	emits	a	fiery glow	when	Ivashu	come	within	700	feet.
- Bane (CL2): this Neutral spell proves to be almost	as	troublesome	to	cast	as	Alarm. After	8	days	(and	a	Minor	Principle	Leak that	left	her	in	Aural	Shock	for	a	day), Laena	settles	on	a	success	(S),	enchanting the sword with a continuous +2 impact against	Ivashu	(day	54).
- Gauntlet (CL5): the last enchantment is the Peleahn spell Gauntlet from one of her Secondary	convocations.	She	has	ML73	and a	+3	bonus	from	her	Jmorvi	Focus.	The	SI7 bonus	effect	of	Gauntlet	allows	its	casting on	a	metal	object	for	a	-10	penalty.	This brings	the	EML	to	66.	With	Agrik	looking on	favourably-again-the	casting	roll is	45	(CS)	on	day	55.	When	activated,	the latent	ethereal	fire	effect	will	have	7	points (page	228).

## effect &amp; duration

The	first	four	enchantments	all	have	a continuous	effect;	Gauntlet	requires	arcane attunement	and	a	Spirit	test	by	the	user	to invoke.	The	sword	has	a	Volition	Secondary Modifier	of	+10	from	its	Ego	15	(ML75).	This applies	as	a	penalty	to	Attunement	Spirit tests	but	a	bonus	to	Invocation	Spirit	tests. Attuners	with	a	Morality	12	or	higher	also suffer	Antipathetic	Reaction.

As	a	Permanent	major	artefact, Reaver will	never	lose	its	enchantments,	unless	the weapon	is	itself	destroyed.	A	Dispel	might work	when	cast	against	the	Indefinite spell effect of	a	successfully	invoked	Gauntlet.

The Ilpylen Reaver receives a full description	and	summary	of	characteristics in Chapter 4: Possessions (page	128).
