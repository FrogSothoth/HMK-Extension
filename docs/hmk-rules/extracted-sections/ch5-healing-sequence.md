# Healing Sequence

## 1 bleeding

<!-- image -->

Healers	must	first	stop	bleeding	injuries	before	attempting	any other	treatments.	A	single	bleeding	injury	represents	an	amount of	exsanguination	that	will	likely	prove	lethal	in	10-15	minutes. Such	blood	loss	does	not	stop	on	its	own.

## blood stoppage roll

A	healer	may	attempt	a	Blood	Stoppage	Roll	once	every 5 minutes with	the	Cauterisation	or	Staunch	treatments.	If	treating	more than	one	bleeding	injury	in	the	same	5-minute	period,	the	healer makes	separate	tests	for	each	one,	applying	a	cumulative	-10 penalty	to	all	tests	per	treated	bleeder	beyond	one.

## physician test

- cf bleeding continues : healer does not stop the bleeding; patient makes	a	Blood	Loss	Advance	Roll	(below).	Healer	may	then	try	again.
- f bleeding continues : as	for	CF,	but	the	healer	receives	+10	bonus	to the next Staunch treatment roll for the same bleeder.
- s bleeding stopped : the	healer	stops	the	injury's	bleeding after the patient	makes	one	more	Blood	Loss	Advance	Roll.
- cs bleeding stopped immediately .

## blood loss advance roll

Victims	make	a	Blood	Loss	Advance	Roll	for	each	bleeder	once every 5 minutes until	bleeding	is	stopped	or	they	die.	This	roll	is made	after	each	Blood	Stoppage	Roll	(if	there	is	one).	The	test	is against Strength ,	reflecting	the	patient's	size	and	thus	blood volume	(exclude	all	fatigue	and	impairment	penalties).	Each	roll accumulates	0-3	Blood	Loss	Points	( bp ):

## strength test

- cf blood loss : victim accrues  3 bp this period .
- f blood loss : victim accrues  2 bp this period .
- s blood loss : victim accrues  1 bp this period .
- cs no bloodloss : victim accrues  no bp this period .

For each accumulated bp ,	check	off	a	box	in	the	character's Shock State table,	moving	left	to	right.

shock

• bp

- [ ] stn

- [ ] inc

- [ ] unc

- [ ] kia

state

As	each	box	is	checked	off,	the	patient	suffers	the	corresponding Shock	State,	dying	upon	acquiring	the	fourth bp (KIA).

- A	STN,	INC,	or	UNC	blood	loss	Shock	State	remains	until	all bleeding	is	stopped.	The	character	then	automatically	removes the	STN	state;	or	makes	a	Shock	Reroll	test	if	INC	or	UNC	(see step	4	of	Injury	Sequence,	page	169).
- The	character	suffers	5	weakness	fatigue	per	BP	from anaemia . This	remains	until	the	blood	naturally	regenerates	(step	6).

Beasts other	than	Folk	are	assumed	to	be	of	their	average, relative	Strength,	so	their	Bleeding	rolls	are	against	ML50 .

## treatments

This table is referenced during steps 1 and 5. If the requirements of a given treatment cannot be met, then the healer cannot perform it and the injury is deemed untreated.

1 Bleeding example :	a	character	suffers	a G4 e right shoulder injury, fails both the Shock and Shock Reroll, and ends up in Extended Shock (INC). Step 3.3 of the Injury Sequence indicates that such an injury is also a Bleeder.

The battle ends a few rounds later,  with the character in an unaware state from the extended shock. Five minutes pass and the character makes a Blood Loss Roll-the Strength ML60 test is a	Failure	(F),	inflicting	two	Blood	Loss	Points	( bp ). This results in Incapacitation, but the character falls unconscious (UNC), having been Incapacitated to begin with (INC while INC equals UNC).

An ally arrives and begins the Staunch treatment. Five more minutes pass and the ally tests Physician ML40. A Success (S) stops the bleeding, but the character must make one last Blood Loss Roll. A Success (S) induces one more bp , for a total of three . The character was already UNC, so the UNC from blood loss has no	other	effect.	The	bleeding	is	stopped,	but	the	character	has 15 weakness fatigue from anaemia and must face the Extended Shock (UNC) trauma in step 2.

## 2 extended shock

<!-- image -->

Incapacitated (INC) or Unconscious (UNC) characters who failed a Shock	Reroll	test	(page	169)	suffer	Extended	Shock.	They	exhibit	a sickly	pallor,	cold	sweats,	weakness,	and	nausea.	Such	characters retain	their	Shock	State	indefinitely.

INC :	character	is	unaware	and	incoherent	but	may	make	a	Difficult half	Move	if	supported	by	another	and	if	injuries	permit	it.	Personal Fatigue	is	accrued	every 10 minutes when	making	such	movement.

UNC :	character	is	unaware,	helpless,	and	may	not	take	actions.

## extended shock course roll

Every four hours the	character	makes	a	Course	Roll.	This	is	a	test	of Healing	Base	(HB)	times	Healing	Rate	4	or	5,	as	indicated	earlier	in the Shock Reroll table	(page	169).

Fatigue : characters do not recover from fatigue while	suffering	Extended Shock,	and	any	accrued	fatigue	applies	as	a	penalty	to	the	Course	Roll.

Treatment :	a	healer	may	grant	a	bonus	to	the	patient's	Extended Shock	Course	Rolls	equal	to 5 times the star result of	a	Physician	SV	test (one	test	per	healer	per	patient;	apply	single	highest	healer's	bonus).

Arcane Recovery : an immediate Course Roll or the single-highest test bonus	resulting	from	an	arcane	source	may	be	applied	(page	213).

2 Extended Shock example : the character from the step 1 example	suffered	a G4 e right shoulder injury and Extended Shock (UNC). The causal Shock Reroll test was a Failure (F), so the	Extended	Shock	HR	is	5.	A	Healing	Base	13	and	15	weariness fatigue	give	EML50	for	the	Extended	Shock	Roll	(HB13 × HR5 - 15 fatigue). The character is attended by an ally who generates a Physician	SV5,	increasing	this	to	EML55	(+5	bonus).

Four hours pass and the roll is 93-a Failure (F) that reduces the HR	to	4,	adjusting	the	next	EML	to	42	(HB13 × HR4 - 15	fatigue	+5 bonus from the ally).

Four more hours pass and the next roll is 41-a Success (S) that increases	the	HR	to	5,	returning	the	next	EML	to	55.

The	next	roll	is	13-Success	(S)	for	HR6.	After	a	total	12	hours, the character has recovered and become conscious, now able to receive	treatment	for	the	G4	shoulder	injury	(steps	4-5).

## physical trauma rolls

Three	types	of	physical	trauma	rolls	are	referenced	in	the	game:

Advance Rolls determine	the	life-threatening	effects	of	blood	loss (page	178),	exposure	(page	185),	and	malnutrition	(page	186).

Course Rolls determine	the	effects	of	extended	shock	(above	left), coma	(above	right),	infection	(page	181),	disease	(page	184)	and	poison/ toxins	(page	186).

Healing Rolls resolve	the	recovery	from	injuries	(page	181),	blood	loss (page	181),	exposure	(page	185),	and	malnutrition	(page	186).

## healing sequence

## 3 coma

<!-- image -->

Unconscious (UNC) characters who get a Critical Failure (CF) on a Shock	Reroll	test	(page	169)	fall	into	an	indefinite	coma	that	lasts beyond	the	duration	of	Extended	Shock	(which	itself	still	requires resolution	in	step	2).	While	in	a	coma,	characters	are	unaware	and may	neither	move	themselves	nor	take	actions.

When	a	character	falls	into	the	coma,	subtract	the Location Shock and Injury Level of	the	injury	that	induced	the	coma	from	twelve (12).	The	result	is	the	initial	Coma	Healing	Rate	(HR)	used	in	the accompanying	Course	Roll,	below:

coma hr  =  12  -  location shock  -  injury level

## coma course roll

Every d10 days the	character	makes	a	Course	Roll.	This	is	a	test	of Healing	Base	(HB)	times	the	initial	Healing	Rate	determined	above.

Fatigue :	once	they	no	longer	suffer	Extended	Shock,	characters recover from fatigue normally while	in	a	coma.	With	Course	Rolls	every d10	days,	only	weakness	fatigue	is	likely	to	apply	as	a	penalty.

Treatment :	no	Physician	test	helps	coma	recovery;	however,	not being	in	a	restful,	sheltered	environment	induces	-20	penalty.

Arcane Recovery : an immediate Course Roll or the single-highest test bonus	resulting	from	an	arcane	source	may	be	applied	(page	213).

## area injury treatment

Fire or frost impact to a single location follows the Healing Sequence	like	any	other	discrete	injury.	However, Area	fire and frost injuries	imply	a	diffuse	coverage	over	the	body-roughly 15	to	20	per	cent	coverage	per	Severity	Level-and	so	function differently	in	several	respects:

## shock

Area G4 f and G5 f injuries	that	do	not	kill	the	target	from	shock are	always grim wounds (page	180)	regardless	of	treatment.	Only esoteric	measures	can	save	the	patient.

## treatment rolls (healing step 5)

Healers	make	a	single	Treatment	Roll	for	an	Area	injury,	but the	Physician	ML	test	includes	an	additional -20	penalty to the Treatment	Difficulty	modifier	in	the Treatment Roll table.

## healing rolls (healing step 6)

A	CF	occurs	on	a	failed	Healing	Roll	when	the	ones	die	is	a	3,	5,	8, or	0	(instead	of	just	a	5	or	0).

## impairment (healing step 8)

Area	injuries	impair	all	actions	&amp;	movement	like head injuries.

<!-- image -->

## 4 injury type

Once	a	patient's	bleeding	and	extended	shock	end,	a	healer	may treat	an	injury.	The	Injury	Type	is	defined	by	its	aspect	and	severity:

## aspect

Treatment	varies	according	to	the	strike	aspect	that	inflicted	the injury-Blunt,	Edge,	Point,	Projectile,	Fire,	or	Frost.	Projectile	is	a	type of	Point	aspect	caused	by	arrows	and	bolts.

## severity

Treatment	also	varies	according	to	whether	the	injury	is	Minor	(M), Serious	(S),	or	Grievous	(G).

<!-- image -->

## treatment

Find	the	Injury	Type	among	the Treatment Roll tables	to	the	right. The abbreviation in the trt row refers to the required treatment as described in the Treatments table	(page	178).

## treatment roll

The healer performs the treatment and then tests Physician , modified	by	the	following	factors:

Treatment Difficulty :	each	treatment	has	a	mandatory	Modifier ( mod )	that	reflects	its	complexity.

Treatment Delay :	for	each	day	that	has	passed	since	the	injury occurred,	apply	-5	penalty.

The	Success	Level	usually	produces	a Healing	Rate (HR) for the patient's	injury.	Several	other	results	can	also	occur-see	the	key below	the	table	(bottom	right).

A	given	healer	or	assistant	may	be	involved	in	only	one	Treatment Roll	per	injury	per	patient.

## multiple treatment rolls

Multiple	healers	may	each	attempt	a	Treatment	Roll	for	the	same injury	only	if	the	subsequent	healers	have	a	higher	Physician	Index than	all	previous	ones.	Only	the	highest	Success	Level	applies,	except a	CF	Treatment	Roll	by	any	healer	replaces	all	other	results.

## grievous injury maximum hr

The	maximum	attainable	HR	for	a	Grievous	Injury	equals	the	healer's Physician	Index	(or	the	CF	level,	if	higher).	The	HR	cap	brings	the other	effects	commensurate	to	its	level.	For	example,	a	healer	with Physician	Index	3	who	gets	a	CS	for	a	G4	Edge	Injury	imparts	an	HR3 with a bleeder and a chance of impairment and infection -not	an	HR5.

## untreated injury

An	injury	that	does	not	receive	an	actual	Treatment	Roll	has	all	the treatment	characteristics	of	a	CF	result	for	its	given	injury	type.

## grim wound

A	Grievous	Injury	with	CF	treatment-either	rolled	or	imparted	from lack	of	treatment-is	termed	a	grim	wound.	Grim	wounds	force the	victim	to	make	a	Shock	Roll	(step	4,	page	169) once per day after incurring the trauma until it is no longer Grievous or the treatment is no	longer	CF.	Use	the	wound's	Location	Shock	for	step	4.1.

## 6 healing

<!-- image -->

Patients	make	Healing	Rolls	to	determine	how	quickly	injuries	heal and	blood	loss	is	restored.

Arcane Recovery : an immediate Healing Roll or the single-highest test	bonus	from	an	arcane	sources	may	be	applied	(page	213).

## injury healing roll

A	patient	makes	a	separate	Healing	Roll	for	each	injury	every five	days after	incurring	it.	A	Healing	Roll	is	a	test	of Healing Base (HB) times the injury's Healing Rate (HR) .

Cauterisation : failed Healing Rolls of injuries whose bleeders were stopped	by	the	Cauterisation	treatment	are	Critical	Failure	when	the ones	die	result	is	a	3,	5,	8,	or	0.

## healing base × healing rate

- cf no effect : there	is	no	healing	this	period.	If	the	treatment	left	the chance	for	infection,	then	the	injury	also	becomes	infected	(step	7).
- f no effect : there is no healing this period.
- s healing : reduce	the	Injury	Level	by	1 . When	reduced	to	0	or	less,	the injury	is	fully	healed.
- cs healing : as	above,	but	reduce	the	Injury	Level	by	2.

Severity Reduction :	as	injury	level	lessens,	the	injury	severity	does	as well	at	certain	points-from	G4	to	S3;	and	then	from	S2	to	M1.	When severity	changes,	the	effects	described	under	Injury	Effects	(page	170) and	Impairment	(step	8,	page	182)	alter	accordingly.

Random Option :	if	the	precise	timing	is	important	to	the	campaign's narrative,	the	static	five-day	healing	period	can	be	randomised	with	a roll	of	d3 + 3	(four	to	six	days;	roll	for	each	period).

## blood loss healing roll

A	patient	who	has	accumulated	Blood	Loss	Points	suffers	5	weakness Fatigue per bp due to anaemia .	Every ten days after	suffering	the	blood loss,	the	character	tests Endurance to	regenerate	the	blood	(apply only	weakness	penalty	other	than	that	from	anaemia):

## endurance test

- cf no effect : no	regeneration	during	this	or	the	next	period;	then	reroll.
- f no effect : no regeneration; reroll next period.
- s blood regenerated : reduce bp by	1.	Fatigue	penalty	lessens	by	5.
- cs blood regenerated : as	above,	but	reduce bp by	2	and	Fatigue	by	10.

## infection

An	injury	whose	treatment	carries	the	possibility	for	infection	is noted	by	the								             or                     shade in the Treatment Roll tables. Such	an	injury	becomes	infected	when	one	of	its	Healing	Rolls	is	a	CF in	step	6.	If	this	happens,	Healing	Rolls	for	all injuries must cease until the	patient	defeats	the	infection.

## infection course roll

The	patient	makes	an	Infection	Course	Roll once per day .	This	is	a test	of	Healing	Base	times	a	Healing	Rate	equal	to	the	injury's	own Healing	Rate	plus	1	(maximum	HR5).	For	instance,	an	injury	with	HR3 has	infection	HR4.

Treatment :	an	attending	healer	may	grant	a	bonus	to	the	patient's Infection Course Rolls equal to the SV of a Physician SV	test.

Amputation : amputating an infected limb also defeats infection; follow	the	Amputation	treatment	as	for	frost	injuries	(page	178).

Arcane Recovery : an immediate Course Roll or the single-highest test bonus	from	an	arcane	sources	may	be	applied	(page	213).

5 Treatment example : a character with an S2 edge injury to the abdomen receives a failed (F) Treatment Roll. The injury has Healing	Rate	4	and	the	chance	for	infection.	It	also	imparts	10 impairment (step 8).

6 7 Healing-Infection example : the character with the S2 abdomen	injury	has	a	Healing	Base	13.	After	five	days,	the	first Healing	Roll	is	made	against	EML52	(HB13 × HR4).	The	roll	is 62-failure	and	no	effect.	Five	days	later	another	Healing	Roll is made and the result is 24-success, reducing the S2 injury to M1. The 10 impairment is reduced to 5 impairment because of the injury's	HR4;	if	the	injury's	HR	had	been	6,	the	M1	injury	would have no impairment (step 8, page 182).

Five	more	days	pass	and	the	next	Healing	Roll	is	95-CF; no reduction and the injury is now infected. Since the abdomen injury	has	HR 4,	the	daily	Infection	Healing	Rolls	have	HR5,	or EML65	(HB13 × HR5).	The	first	is	made	one	day	later	and	the	roll is	42-Success	(S);	the	infection	HR	improves	to	6,	ending	the current infection.

Five	days	later	Healing	Rolls	resume	and	the	result	is	42success against EML52. The M1 is reduced by one Injury Level, so the	injury	has	completely	healed	after	21	total	days.

## 8 impairment

Over	the	course	of	healing,	a	Minor	injury	might	impart 5 impairment to	the	location's	body	zone;	a	Serious	injury	imparts 10 impairment ; and	a	Grievous	injury	makes	the	zone unusable .

## indefinite impairment

The	effects	of	impairment	are	usually	indefinite.

Minor Injury :	the	5	impairment	exists	only	if	the	injury's HR	is	5	or	less ; if	so,	the	impairment	lasts	until	the	injury	heals.

Serious Injury :	the	10	impairment	of	a	Serious	injury	lasts	until	it heals	to	a	Minor	injury.	At	that	point,	it	impairs	as	a	Minor	Injury-5 impairment	with	HR5	or	less;	no	impairment	with	HR6.

Grievous Injury :	when	a	Grievous	injury	heals	to	Serious,	the location's	zone	can	be	used	but	now	suffers	10	impairment.	When	it heals	to	Minor,	there	is	5	impairment	only	with	HR5	or	less.

## permanent impairment

An	injured	location	whose	treatment	includes	a	black	box	( ) might induce	permanent	impairment.

Healing Days :	for	every	20	days	it	takes	the	injury	to	heal	to	a	Minor injury,	the	location's	zone	accrues 5 permanent impairment .	The	total includes	days	spent	fighting	off	infection	(step	7).

| days   | impairment   | days   | impairment   |
|--------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| < ��   | none         | 6�-79  | 15permanent  |
| ��-39  | 5permanent   | 8�-99  | ��permanent  |
| 4�-59  | 1�permanent  | 1��+   | �5permanent  |

Minor and Serious Injury : permanent impairment overlaps with indefinite	impairment-only	the	higher	of	the	two	applies	at	a	given moment	for	the	same	injury	(see	example 8 ).

Grievous Injury :	since	a	Grievous	injury	makes	the	zone	unusable, accrued permanent impairment is ignored until the location heals to	a	Serious	Injury.	From	then	on,	only	the	higher	of	permanent	or indefinite	impairment	applies.

Permanent	impairment	affects	Impaired	tests	and	Move	just	like indefinite	impairment	(page	170).	For	example,	the	10	permanent impairment	from	a	badly	healed	pelvis	injury	reduces	Move	and applies	to	almost	all	Physical,	Combat,	and	Agility	tests.

Permanent	impairment	penalty	is	recorded	in	the	same	box	as that	for	indefinite	impairment,	but	the	player	must	either	circle	it	as	a reminder	of	its	permanency	or	record	this	fact	in	the	Notes	section.

8 Impairment example :	a	character	suffers	a G4 e right shoulder injury and receives                      treatment. The right arm zone is unusable (G4); and might incur permanent impairment even	after	healing	( ).	There	is	also	the	chance	for	infection throughout	its	healing	( ). hr3

Assume it takes three healing rolls to reduce the G4 to an S3 injury ( 15	days ). The shoulder can now be used but with 10 indefinite impairment. It then takes one more healing roll to lessen it to an S2 injury ( 20	days total). As indicated in the step 8 table, the right arm zone accrues 5 permanent impairment because	its	recovery	has	so	far	taken	20	days.	However,	the…

## concentration

The	loss	of	concentration	is	a	special	type	of	impairment. Characters must be able to maintain it in order to perform 1+ round actions in	combat	(page	160),	and	other	long-term	tasks, like	difficult	climbs	and	crafting.	Concentration	is	also	required for	all	esoteric	actions,	no	matter	how	long	they	take,	including spellcasting	and	invocation,	spell	and	alchemical	research, entering	a	trance,	or	giving	divinatory	readings.	The	rules	specify other	endeavours	that	require	concentration,	and	the	GM	may call	for	it	in	unique	cases.		A	Will	test	could	be	made	to	determine whether	it	is	broken	by	trivial	distractions	( shouting , shoving ).

The	following	states,	conditions,	and	trauma	automatically interrupt	and	prevent	any	action	requiring	concentration.

| Stunned (STN)*      | Grievous Skull Injury            |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Incapacitated (INC) | GrimWound(page180)               |
| Unconscious (UNC)   | Afraid, Terrified, or Catatonic. |

*Character	is	still	aware	but	tests	Awareness	at	-1	success	level.

## serious injury aggravation option

As	an	optional	rule,	using	a	location	with	a	Serious	injury	could bring	some	risk	of	aggravating	wounds.

Actions : an Impaired test that results in Critical Failure (CF) requires a separate Shock SR for	each	Serious	injury	whose	zone was	used	in	the	action.	A	failure	reduces	the	injury's	Healing Rate	by	1	down	to	a	minimum	HR1.	For	an	untreated	injury,	this reduction	is	carried	to	the	HR	resulting	from	future	treatment.

Move :	moving	while	suffering	a	Serious	head,	torso,	or	leg	injury requires an Agility test	every	turn	at	a	full	Move	(or	with	the Charge	action);	or	every	four	hours	at	a	half	Move.	A	CF	triggers	an aggravation	Shock	SR	(as	above).	Double	Moves	are	not	allowed.

| rate       | agl test period   |
|------------|-------------------|
| halfmove   | perfourhours      |
| fullmove   | perturn           |
| charge     | perturn           |
| doublemove | notallowed        |

Example : taking the Charge action with a Serious torso injury requires an AGL test each turn: a CF forces the Shock SR to check for aggravation.

A	CF	Impaired	test	while	using	a	Serious	injury-that	induces	the Shock	SR	check-	also	induces	one	for	each Grievous injury	that might	plausibly	be	aggravated	by	the	CF	action.

While	zones	with	Grievous	injury	usually	cannot	be	used	in the	first	place,	a	character	who chooses to	take	action	anyway automatically	achieves	a	CF	(see	page	170)	and,	with	this	option, must	then	also	check	it	for	aggravation	with	a	Shock	SR.

…10	indefinite	impairment	from	being	a	Serious	injury	is	what currently applies, since it is the higher of the two penalties.

The next healing roll is a success, improving the S2 to an M1 injury. The 5 permanent impairment to the right arm zone remains because it took 25	days to heal to a Minor injury. The usual	5	indefinite	impairment	of	a	Minor	injury	with	a	HR5	or	less is	subsumed	in	the	5	permanent	penalty.	Healing	rolls	continue in	order	to	check	for	infection	(Healing	Sequence	step	7)	and compounding during interim battles (Injury Sequence step 3.1).

Once the injury is fully healed, the player notes the 5 permanent impairment in the white box of the Right Arm zone.

## ailments

In addition to fatigue and injury, characters may face a variety of physical trauma called ailments: asphyxia , disease , exposure , malnutrition , poison &amp; toxin , and sleep deprivation . Injury infection and anaemia are also ailments, but their rules are in the Healing Sequence (page 178).

Arcane Recovery : certain Fyvria spells, the Healing talent, and Healing elixir can all assist a patient's recovery from ailments. The assistance is a test bonus, or an immediate Healing, Course, or Advance Roll. For the three Roll types resulting from such arcane sources, all failures (F or CF) simply have no effect -only successes apply to the respective tables.

## Asphyxia

Characters who cannot get enough air suffer asphyxia. Whatever the source-choking, drowning, smoke inhalation-the course of asphyxia is measured by how long characters can resist it by holding their breath.

Breath-holding : characters may hold their breath for a base number of five-second rounds equal to their Endurance (END) attribute. The number of base rounds is extended by the SV result of a Will SV test. Once characters can no longer hold their breath, they fall unconscious and die in half END attribute score plus d10 rounds.

One-half Swimming ML may replace END to figure base rounds. For example, a character with Swimming ML56 and END 12 has a base of �� rounds rather than 12.

Asphyxia Fatigue and Recovery : holding your breath for more than half your maximum capacity induces 5 windedness fatigue upon completion. Characters who actually fall unconscious-but are saved before deathmust apply the success level result of an Endurance test on the Shock Reroll table (page 169), without its usual -20 penalty.

## Disease

When characters face contracting a disease, follow the eight steps on this and the next page (referring to the Disease tables in the sidebar).

[�] Transmission : the way a disease passes between victims is called transmission. There are four methods (see sidebar).

[�] Contagion Roll : if exposed to its transmission, characters make a Contagion Roll equal to Contagion Index (CI) times Endurance (END). Each disease has a CI between 1 and 5 that measures how easily a character contracts it (select or roll d20 for it in the bottom sidebar table). The lower the CI, the more contagious the disease.

[�] Onset : characters who fail the Contagion Roll contract the disease. The time between contracting it and the first symptoms appearing is called onset. Most diseases have an onset of d6 days (halve the result if the Contagion Roll was a CF). Roll this randomly each time a character contracts a disease; the onset of the same disease can vary.

[�] Symptoms : characters who contract a disease begin to express its symptoms after the onset period. Generate symptoms by rolling four separate d10s on the sidebar table (do not reroll duplicate results).

[�] Virulence : how strongly a disease attacks is called virulence, measured by the Healing Rate (HR) it imparts when characters first contract it (select or roll for it). Extremely lethal diseases have HR1-2.

## stranglehold

Strangulation restricts blood flow to the head, not the air flow as in asphyxia. To attempt to strangle a target, the combatant makes a Melee attack with an Unarmed (Grab).

Awareness : whether the target is aware, unaware, or helpless (page 158) greatly affects the Grab attack.

Grab : a successful Grab Attack induces a Grab Roll (page 106). An attacker who wins this then selects the Hold suboption. A strike to the Head location induces the stranglehold.

Stranglehold : each full round thereafter that the Grab is maintained, the victim makes a Shock Roll against SHK 7. Once reached, unconsciousness lasts only 3d6 rounds if the stranglehold is immediately released.

## sample disease

The GM may also use the Disease routine to generate unique diseases.

Disease example : the GM selects contact as the type of transmission (step 1) and decides it will be from the excrement of seagulls, numerous throughout the kingdom's coastal towns.

Two d20 are rolled in the sidebar tables on page 183, one for a random Contagion Index (CI) and one for the Virulence Healing Rate (HR). A roll of 7 generates CI2 ; and a 15 gives HR4 -contagious but not very lethal.

Four d10 are rolled for symptoms in step 3: 8 ( pain ), 3 ( diarrhoea ), 0 ( vomiting ), and 7 ( rash ). The GM decides these symptoms will occur in the order they were rolled: abdominal cramps (pain) appear first near the end of the onset, followed by simultaneous diarrhoea and vomiting throughout its course, with a blotchy rash appearing on the chest and arms if a victim reaches HR3.

When both diarrhoea and vomiting begin, victims unable to consume double their resting water requirements will suffer -20 penalty on Course Rolls in step 6. Herbal Curatives can offer a bonus (page 75). Given the maritime theme of the campaign, the GM names the disease the Sea Plague . While more ominous sounding than its actual lethality, even a single failed Course Roll will debilitate an active PC.

Sea Plague Course Example : Faldrik arrives in Gythrun, a small coastal town currently afflicted by the Sea Plague. A test roll against his END12 × CI2 results in 31, a Failure (F) and a contraction of the disease. The GM rolls a 3 for the d6 Onset, the number of days after arrival when Faldrik starts to feel body aches (the pain symptom) and gains 10 weakness fatigue (from the initial HR4). On day four, a Course Roll is made against ML44 (his HB11 × current HR4)-a 57 (F) reduces the HR to 3, leaving Faldrik Stunned (replacing the 10 fatigue) and with pain and diarrhoea . The next day the Course Roll is 11 (a Success against ML33), returning the Outcome to HR4 (10 weakness fatigue) with only the pain. On day 6, Faldrik fully recovers to HR6 with a CS Course Roll-he has survived.

<!-- image -->

[�] Treatment : the ability of Kethirans to cure virulent disease is very limited. After symptoms present, a healer may make a Physician Success Value test. The SV result applies as a bonus to the patient's ensuing Course Rolls in step 7 (below).

Self-treatment : characters may only self-treat diseases with an initial HR of 4 or 5.

[�] Course Roll : each day after the onset period, the character makes a Course Roll, a test of the character's Healing Base times the Healing Rate ( HB × HR ), modified by treatment (step 6). The result determines the disease's new Healing Rate.

## disease course roll

|    | healingbase×healingrate   | healingbase×healingrate               |
|----|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|

| s  | +1 healing rate           | Outcome table in step 8 to determine  |
| cs | +2 healing rate           | the effect of the disease's progress. |

[�] Outcome : starting with the result of the first Course Roll after onset, locate the current HR on the following table to see the associated outcome. When HR improves to 6, the patient defeats the disease. With each lowering of HR, the ailment worsens. If it reaches HR0, the character dies. Outcomes do not combine; the patient's most recent outcome replaces the previous one.

| hr   | outcome            |                                   |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|

| hr5  | 5 weaknessfatigue  | Character acquires the condition  |

| hr�  | dead               | Patient dies.                     |

Symptoms : an ailment's symptoms usually all present at its onset, but sometimes they might gradually appear in stages from HR5 to HR3.

Non-lethal outcomes : some diseases might never reach lower than HR2 or HR1, thus having no risk of death. Others might have nonlethal HR0 outcomes that leave the victim with permanent paralysis, blindness, or deafness. These could also be temporary symptoms that accompany the course, whether lethal or not. Consider these effects:

Amnesia : memory loss, resulting in -40 penalty to REA and Lore tests to recall the past, or even in loss of identity in severe cases.

Blindness : loss of sight; DEX and AGL tests, or skill tests with either of them in the Skill Base, have -40 penalty if not deemed impossible. Moving faster than a Half Move causes a Stumble Roll.

Deafness : loss of hearing; PER and Awareness tests based upon hearing are an automatic CF should a test be required.

Muteness : no speaking or cant-based spellcasting allowed.

Paralysis : no use of the affected limb; if completely paralysed, character may not move at all, falling and remaining prone and helpless against all attacks (see Deadly Attacks, page 191).

## Exposure

Characters face trauma in extreme weather conditions, described here as either Cold Exposure or Heat Exposure .

## cold exposure

Suffering an extreme drop in core body temperature can prove fatal. Step 7.3 of the Trekking Routine (page 149) explains how characters might encounter such cold exposure.

Characters suddenly falling into cold water also face a more dangerous ailment called Cold Shock , which is immediately resolved first (see sidebar Cold Exposure Virulence table).

[�] Virulence : the Healing Rate (HR) and period varies by whether the character is dry, damp from rain, or immersed in chilly water.

[�] Advance : each period the character tests Healing Base times Healing Rate ( HB × HR ) to determine the advance of the cold exposure.

## exposure advance roll

[�] Symptoms : nausea and dizziness; at HR5 and HR4, uncontrollable shivering, disappearing by HR3 where it is replaced with a euphoria that can elicit bizarre behaviour (treat as a Psyche Disorder, page 188).

[�] Healing : characters must first be removed from the cold and water conditions that caused the exposure. If the Warming treatment is then applied, test HB × 5 every 2 hours until fully recovered at HR6.

## heat exposure

Suffering an extreme rise in core body temperature can prove fatal. Step 7.3 of the Trekking Routine explains how characters might encounter such heat exposure. The rules conflate a series of syndromes that progress from heat cramps, to heat exhaustion, to heat stroke.

[�] Virulence : HR begins at 4 or 5 (see table in Heat Hazard, page 149).

[�] Advance : every four hours the character tests HB × HR to determine the advance on the Exposure Advance Roll table as for step 2  under cold exposure, above.

[�] Symptoms : headache, nausea, dizziness; confusion sets in at HR3.

[�] Healing : the patient must get out of direct sunlight. Then the Compress treatment is applied-test HB × 5 every 15 minutes until fully recovered at HR6. Characters bathed in cool water test once every 5 minutes . Use the Exposure Healing Roll table (Cold Exposure, step 4).

## frostbite

Freezing air temperature inflicts one frost Injury Level (IL) per period to each exposed location (AV0); or per two periods to each partially exposed location (AV1-3). The period varies according to windforce.

During one Trekking Routine watch, roll a d20 to determine wind (left table) and a d20 to determine exposure duration (right table).

| d20   | wind    | period   | d20   | dur   |
|-------|---------|----------|-------|-------|
| ≤ 3   | Calm    | 2 hr     | 1-12  | 1 hr  |
| 4-17  | Typical | 1 hr     | 13-17 | 2 hr  |
| 18+   | Gale    | 30min    | 18-19 | 3 hr  |
|       |         |          | 20    | 4 hr  |

Example : a character is exposed to frostbite during a four-hour watch because of critically failing a Cold Hazard Endurance (Survival) test in step 7.3 of the Trekking Routine. A d20 roll of 6 says the winds are typical (one hour frostbite periods). A second d20 roll of 14 says the character was exposed to frostbite for two of the four hours. With a wind period of one hour, this means the two-hour exposure inflicts S2 frost injury to each exposed location (1 IL per 1-hour period for 2 hours). Locations with AV1-3 suffer M1 injuries (1 IL per 2-hour period for 2 hours).

## sunburn

For each Location exposed to possible sunburn during a 4-hour watch, make a d10 roll against a TN according to the character's complexion (left table). If less than or equal to the TN, the very same d10 roll determines the burn Injury Level suffered in the Location (right table).

| complexion   |   tn | roll   | burn   |
|--------------|------|--------|--------|
| Very Light   |   10 | 1-6    | M1     |
| Light        |    7 | 7-0    | S2     |
| Medium       |    4 |        |        |
| Dark         |    2 |        |        |
| Very Dark    |    1 |        |        |

## Malnutrition

An inadequate amount of food can be debilitating and eventually fatal. The lack of water is much more dangerous and quickly kills. Each is a separate ailment.

## starvation

Characters need about three pounds of trail rations or fresh food each day, assuming brisk activity such as trekking. Halve this amount with complete rest.

[�] Onset : after one day without food (or two days on half rations), the character acquires the Starvation condition.

[�] Virulence : HR5 at onset. Apply the corresponding effect from the Outcome table as for diseases (page 184).

[�] Advance : after the onset, the character makes an Advance Roll every three days , or every six days on half rations, on the Exposure Advance Roll table (page 185). Double the period of days with complete rest.

[�] Symptoms : headache, lethargy, and weakness.

[�] Healing : each day of consuming a full ration, the character makes a Healing Roll on the Exposure Healing Roll table (page 185). Consuming half rations is treated as starvation, but Advance Rolls are every six days (step 3).

## thirst

Assuming eight hours of brisk activity and moderate temperatures, characters require one gallon of water each day. Double the amount in hot weather, such as under a Heat Hazard in the Trekking Routine (page 149). Halve the amount for complete inactivity.

[�] Onset : after one day without the requisite water (or two days on half rations), the character acquires the Thirst condition. This resolves separately from Starvation.

[�] Virulence : HR4 at onset. Apply the corresponding effect from the Outcome table as for diseases (page 184).

[�] Advance : after the onset, the character makes an Advance Roll every day , or every two days on half rations, on the Exposure Advance Roll table (page 185). Double the period of days with complete rest.

[�] Symptoms : headache, dizziness, and weakness.

[�] Healing : each day of consuming a full ration, the character makes a Healing Roll on the Exposure Healing Roll table (page 185). Consuming half rations is treated as thirst, but Advance Rolls are every two days (step 3).

Malnutrition Example : Obris treks in moderate temperatures through an unfamiliar mountainous rockfield during autumn. Eight leagues from a purported hunting lodge, he carries a gallon of water but no food-his last full ration was on the previous day. Obris has Survival ML60 and has shed all Encumbrance.

On day 1 , Obris opts not to forage, pressing on through all three watches of daylight, with each watch requiring one Bearing Mode in the trackless rockfield. The player makes three Orienteering

Rolls, one for each watch (the GM determines there are no Weather Hazards): the results are one star, two stars, and one star. One star is assigned each watch for Obris to keep his bearing, and one Progress Mode is selected in the second watch (but the d10 roll fails). He makes 3 leagues after the three watches. He accrued 0, 5, and 0 weariness fatigue each watch, after accounting for END SR-easily eliminated with rest.

Obris consumes a half gallon/ration of water, which staves off Thirst the first day. However, with no food, he acquires the Starvation condition (HR5: 5 weakness fatigue, as shown in the Outcome table, page 184). The first starvation Advance Roll will be at the end of day 4.

On day 2 , he repeats the same strategy. The 5 weakness fatigue from starvation does not affect movement, not even when added to 10 weariness from three watches of hiking (he failed one END SR). His Orienteering Rolls are similar today-another three leagues covered. He consumes his last half-ration of water and acquires the Thirst condition (HR4: 10 weakness fatigue; for a total 15 when added to Starvation). Day 3 will be much tougher, but he should be able to manage the two leagues to the lodge.

## Poison &amp; Toxin

Poisons and toxins function in several ways as noncontagious 'diseases' (page 183):

[�] Transmission : digested (poisonous concoctions) or vector (animal bite or arrow); very rarely contact.

[�] Onset : usually 10-60 minutes.

[�] Symptoms : the same as for disease.

[�] Virulence : the poison's strength, from HR1 (deadly) to HR5 (mild); use sidebar table on page 183 to generate.

[�] Treatment : similar options as for disease. The herbal concoction for treating poison is antivenin (page 75).

[�] Course : use the Disease Course Roll table (page 184). Time periods for poisons are usually 10-60 minutes.

[�] Outcome : use the Outcome table (page 184).

See poison examples in Skills (Herbalism, page 74); Bestiary ; and Mysteries (Alchemy, page 265). Poisons are usually lethal at HR0, but some might have alternate outcomes, such as paralysis.

## Sleep Deprivation

Characters accrue 15 weariness fatigue every 24 hours without sleep (an END SR success reduces this to 10). They may mitigate some of this weariness by taking a 4-hour rest once per day or, of course, by sleeping (page 176).

Psyche Stress : for every 30 fatigue accrued from sleep deprivation alone, a character gains 1 Psyche Level (PSY), usually as hallucinations. Characters recover from the Psyche Stress (page 189) independently of the fatigue abatement from sleep deprivation. However, the PSY levels impart their own indefinite weakness fatigue (5 per PSY).
