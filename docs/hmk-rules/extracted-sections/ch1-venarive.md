# Venârivè

## Venârivè

HârnMaster supports game play set throughout the entire world of Kethira. The present book focuses on the huge swath of western Lythia called Venarive , a land whose nearly 70 million inhabitants speak scores of languages and express dozens of cultures.

The map on page 12 shows the area's natural vegetation and indicates the location of its 22 cultural regions. More detailed treatment is found in the Venârivè publication; what follows here serves as an introduction for new players, and an overview for veterans.

Great Cities : urban settlements are rated with a Market Size (MKT) between 1 and 9 (page 33). The only four MKT 9 cities in Venarive are shown on the map: Livelis (population 80,000), Manquideh (107,000), Meokolis (195,000), and Mokora (72,000).

## Áltôr

Four groups of the semi-nomadic Altic people live in the wild and frozen far north-the coastal Water Alts, the trapping Forest Alts, the farming Valley Alts, and the reindeer-herding Great Alts. Over the centuries they have been pushed to the north by the Quarph and to the west by the Reksyni. The urban settlements in the region result from recent, far-reaching Ivinian colonisation.

## Anzelôria

The upper third of the subcontinent of Anzeloria lies north of the equator, forming the southern boundary of the Venarian Sea. The broad central savannah is inhabited by the pastoralist Pechalari tribal people, while, along the southernmost edge of Venarive, the Neshai tribes of the tropical rainforests practice swidden agriculture, in even greater numbers to the south in Anzeloria proper.

## Ázeryàn

Historically the most powerful and important polity in all of Venarive, its empire once stretched from the shores of the Venarian Sea in the east to the coasts of Hepeker in the west, and from the Sea of Menkris in the north to the edge of Anzeloria in the south. While in the last several hundred years its size has been reduced by half, Azeryani culture and technology still greatly influence the entire region.

A centralist state with a highly stratified society, the Empire of Azeryan is ruled from the great imperial capital of Meokolis. The emperor's rule is bolstered by an extensive civil imperial bureaucracy and a standing army of forty legions spread throughout its lands. The people are more polytheistic than in feudal realms, and the church of Morgath (God of unlife and undeath), proscribed in much of western Venarive, enjoys an open and high status here.

## Béshakan

The vast Beshakan desert is one of the harshest environments on Lythia, and home to a nomadic people called the Besha with their herds of Beshakan camels. They are fierce warriors who derive wealth from raiding trade caravans that cross the desert between the two great cities of Manquideh in Dalkesh and Mokora on the coast of the Shentu Sea.

## B´yria

Along the southern coast of the Venarian Sea lies the empire of Byria, a matriarchal theocracy of the martial Varanian (Laranian) religion. All female members of landholding clans are trained to arms from birth, whereas men are not permitted to bear weapons, and are often kept as illiterate slave labourers. Foreign traders, usually restricted to women of Karejian background, may only enter at the port of Inri. The Byrian Holy Crusade prepares for conquest, on both land and sea, of its powerful eastern neighbour, the Empire of Dalkesh.

## Chogôro &amp; Mafán

The mountainous coastal area of Mafan and Chogoro is a collection of various states that have a mixed cultural heritage, with most realms claiming some link to the semi-mythical Empire of Mafan. The Mafani League of Boliafra in the northeast is notable as one of the most urbanised regions of Lythia, which includes the massive port city of Mokora, a gateway to southeastern Lythia. The League of Serianapi, in the region's far southwest, is culturally Anzelorian, its Shentu people famous for their war-elephant cavalry.

## Dalkésh

The Empire of Dalkesh centres upon the rich and fertile valley of the Targa River. A hotbed of factions and conflict, its society is caste-based, ruled by the military and religious houses, with merchant and various occupational castes below them, and, at the bottom, the 'out-caste', lower than even the slaves owned by higher strata. Dalken theology is both highly polytheistic and dualistic, with adherents of one religion recognising a close association with another-such as the religions of Naveh (discipline) and Alneha (leisure), or the religions of Zarath (mystery) and Shavkan (knowledge). The Dalken military consists of thirty legions and six fleets, vigilant against enemies all around: tribal Besha raiders from the eastern deserts, the combative Byrians to the west, and the Azeryani, their ancient and mighty enemy across the northern waters.

## Emélrenè

One of the oldest states in all of Venarive, the Kingdom of Emelrene is esteemed for its places of learning and native Emhle people, who maintain a traditional lifestyle throughout the wilderness mountains of northwestern Venarive. The Kingdom was founded in large part to guard the lands between the Es rivers, an area full of strange magical areas called lællyn . One such zone, high in the eastern Jerinalian Mountains, is said to harbour slumbering dragons, not seen since the volatile Time of Fire over six hundred years ago.

## Hácherdad

The Grand Principality of Hacherdad takes its name from a city-state of the same name, allied with seven other principalities. The Hacherim are related to the Besha nomads to the south but have been recently influenced by the Karejians to the west. Their unique religion highlights devotion to a group of 'angels' and 'devils' who serve a duality of deities. They are also famed esotericists, with the city-state of Hacherdad home to one of the largest guilds of arcane lore in all of Venarive, an extensive complex which includes chantries of each of the six branches of Shek-Pvar mages, all in one location.

## Hârbáal

The realms of Harbaal were a group of Ivinian colony states until unified into a great-kingdom 50 years ago. The cultural heritage of its people mixes Ivinian, local Yarla (Jarind), Altic, and Quarphic traditions. The decentralised nature of the great-kingdom has made expressing its full military power challenging.

Chélemby : the largest urban centre in the north is also the name of the independent city-state on an island off the southwest coast of Harbaal (page 80). Its people are even more cosmopolitan than their Harbaaler neighbours, and their trading networks stretch throughout Venarive.

## Hârn

The isle of Hârn-called the Misty Isle for its heavy rainfall and thick fogs-is by far the largest of an archipelago off the northwest coast of Lythia. It is inhabited by a score of tribal groups and several small, mostly feudal, realms, as well as the two likely most powerful enclaves of elven- and dwarven-folk in all Kethira. Its geographical location, and strict foreign trade controls, isolate the region economically from the rest of Venarive. Its monstrous fauna and sorcerous history enhance its reputation as a bizarre, dangerous, yet fascinating land.

The West : the kingdoms of Kanday and Rethem, and the Republic of Tharda, maintain a tenuous peace, having fought several wars over recent decades. Tribal folk in the rugged northern wilderness look to recover lands lost to these three 'civilised' realms.

The North : The Kingdom of Orbaal is ruled by an Ivinian minority who, over the past �� years, conquered the native majority Jarin, still today dreaming of rebellion.

The East : the Kingdom of Kaldor faces a succession crisis, while the Kingdom of Melderyn guides the entire region's politics from its capital on the mysterious Wizard's Isle off the southeast coast. Both lay claim to the tiny Kingdom of Chybisa situated between them.

## Hèpekéria

The island of Hepeker forms the western boundary of Venarive. A 2,000-kilometre-wide desert (the Great Western and Eastern Erg) covers most of its interior. Grassland and evergreen hardwood create a hospitable zone around its rim, especially along the eastern coast facing the Venarian Sea. A confederation of nomadic tribes controls the vast rugged hinterland, largely sustained by the 'ship of the desert'-the Hepekerian camel. The realms of the north have been at a cultural crossroad for centuries, while vestigial states born from the ancient Azeryan Empire flourish on the east coast. Along the southern edge are the Falani, acclaimed metalworkers.

## Huriséa

A land of rivers and marshes, Hurisea is the western part of Quarphor, its people descendants of traditional nomads. The region now consists of many independent and semiindependent states, with both domestic and foreign powers vying for control. Its politics are an especially complex mosaic of secret alliances.

## Ivínia

The island of Ivae and its clan-based Ivinian people dominate northwestern Venarive. The Ivinians are a fierce, warlike people, famous for both raiding and trading far and wide. They have established colonies from Harbaal to Hepekeria and even into lands around the Venarian Sea. Especially adept at sea-borne attacks in their squaresailed warships, Ivinian warriors are commonly hired as mercenaries and marines across the region.

## Karéjia

Up until a few generations ago, the Karejian islands and Lythian shores were provinces of the Azeryani Empire. The current Karejian League was formed to maintain the independence of its many city-state members. At its centre-called the 'navel of the world'-is Livelis, the greatest port of Venarive, where several Lythian traderoutes meet. The Karejians are most known for their many fleets of merchant galleys, called larun , which make longranging seasonal voyages throughout all Venarive.

## Ketârh Ketârh

The Ketarh Plateau in Venarive is the westernmost location of the Ketari people who inhabit the vast grasslands of central Lythia. These nomadic horse people trade with realms to the north or raid passing caravans and have very few permanent settlements. The Ketari are quite distantly related to the Reksyni horse lords to the north, their languages still vaguely similar.

## Palíthanè Palíthanè

The Kingdom of Palithane was formed two hundred years ago when Ivinian invaders assaulted western Trierzon and emerged victorious with the help of a native Trierzi count. The currently united Palithane still expresses these two separate cultural heritages. The Ivinians control the realms along the coast, their Palithaner language remaining mutually intelligible with Ivinian, while the inland Thaneman folk speak a Trierzi dialect. Still to this day, Palithane clashes with the Kingdom of Trierzon (see Waleden, below, in the Trierzon entry).

## Quârphor Quârphor

The region comprises wooded and grassy plains fed by several great rivers. Over the centuries the Quarph have been pushed westward by the Reksyni and now their culture carries mixed heritage. Some maintain a traditional semi-nomadic tribal lifestyle, while others have formed settlements and minor states. Quarphic religion stems from a dualistic shamanism, where two chief spirits-one male and one female- are respectively associated with the sun and the moon. Temples usually have one male and one female priest, often married. The region comprises wooded and grassy plains fed by several great rivers.

## Reks´yna Reks´yna

The Reksyni Confederation is a pan-tribal grouping of the semi-nomadic horse and cattle people who roam the highlands of central Lythia. Their unity is not assured-the current lord of the sky ( khela ), ostensibly the single ruler, fends off claims to power from various regional windlords ( aneke ). Reksyni leaders fill both secular and religious roles, but, while there is no separate priesthood, some prestigious individuals are known as prophets.

## Shôrk´ynè Shôrk´ynè

The Kingdom of Shorkyne is a large feudal realm with an effective authority split between a weak monarch, whose power remains isolated to his own royal domains, and the near-independent dukes and counts. Plagued historically by civil wars, Shorkyne remains bound by its parties facing the shared external threats of Trierzon to the south, Harbaal to the north, and Quarphor to the east. Their large feudal muster includes renowned archers, trained from youth to span powerful war bows.

## Thónia

The volcanic Thonian Alps, the highest peaks in all of Lythia, dominate the peninsula of southwest Venarive. Its snow-capped mountains descend into lush, hot jungle, riven by swamps, lakes, and rivers, and populated by a hardy, diverse folk. The Thon seemingly share a common language, but tribes isolated in the valleys throughout its rugged geography often speak nearly mutually unintelligible dialects.

## Tríerzòn

The Kingdom of Trierzon is the most powerful feudal realm in Venarive. Having freed themselves from the Empire of Azeryan two hundred years ago, the Trierzi nobility now field strong standing armies to supplement the annual feudal levies. The Trierzi language includes many diverse dialects, with speakers from opposite ends of the kingdom often having trouble communicating.

Wáleden : a town on the western border, Waleden was besieged months ago by forces of the Kingdom of Palithane in response to losses incurred when the Trierzi Duke of Stalfore invaded their own eastern lands.

## Ûmélria

The Umelrian League of city-states was founded over 60 years ago as a defensive measure during the Karejian rebellion and Dalkeshi war against Azeryan. The League maintains a tenuous peace with the Reksyni horse lords to the north. Their religion strongly reflects the polytheistic nature of Azeryan.

Elder Folk : a small dark-skinned folk called the Nablugi are said to dwell in remote valleys. It is believed they know of the hidden Kuzhan (dwarven) Kingdom of Erdar nearby.

## venârivè population

As indicated in the table below, three eastern regions alone-Azeryan, Dalkesh, and Karejia-account for nearly half of Venarive's estimated 70 million inhabitants:
