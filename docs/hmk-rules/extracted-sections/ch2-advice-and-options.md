# Advice & Options

## advice &amp; options: character

This	section	gives	advice	and	options	for	character	generation.

## appendix iii: character detail

Appendix III: Character Detail provides more characteristics to consider: appearance (hair	and	eye	colour,	height	and	weight); handedness (left,	right,	or	both);	and story (family	size	and number	of	siblings;	marriage	status).	Players	can	randomly determine	these	features	or	just	choose	them	(page	427).

Players	may	wish	to	flesh	out	their	character's	past	even	more to	include	motives,	formative	events,	influences,	and	contacts. Other	players	may	prefer	to	leave	some	elements	yet	answered, considering	them	only	as	the	game	unfolds.	The	GM	might	also assign information or suggest features about the characters that pertain	to	the	milieu	of	the	impending	campaign.

## attributes score total option

Although	HârnMaster	encourages	players	to	modify	or	switch freely	their	characters'	Attribute	scores,	gaming	groups	can	also consider	the	following	quantifiable	option.

- The	sums	of	each	group	of	six	Physical	and	Mental	Attributes generated with a 4d6 array must equal at least 73 .	If	not,	the player	increases	the	group	of	six	attributes	in	any	manner so	that	their	total	scores	equal	73.	Make	this	calculation	and adjustment	independently	for	Physical	and	Mental	scores.
- For	Physical	Attributes	generated	with 5d6 ,	the	minimum	sum is 80 ; for those using a 3d6 array,	the	minimum	is 63 .

## subattributes

Players	may	wish	to	roll	three	separate	Perception	attributesEyesight	(EYE),	Hearing	(HRG),	and	Smell	(SML).	When	doing so,	consult	the	special Skill Groups table to the right when calculating	Skill	Bases	(this	replaces	the	table	on	page	46).

Awareness Skill is	now	divided	into	three	subskills-Awareness ( sight ),	Awareness	( sound ),	and	Awareness	( odour ).	Their Mastery	Levels	improve	using	a single Skill	Multiple	but according to their own Skill	Base.	Characters	may	test	one	of	the Olfactory	[ o ]	skills	(Alchemy,	Brewing,	Cookery,	Embalming, Herblore,	or	Perfumery)	if	the	odour	in	question	specifically pertains	to	it.	For	more	discussion,	see	Senses	in	Advice	&amp; Options, Chapter 3: Skills (page	93).

Creatures in the Bestiary chapter are still listed with a unified	Perception	score.	Moreover,	their	given	Scent	Index (SNT)	remains	unchanged	and	still	plays	its	dominant	role	in adjudicating	encounters	with	most	animals	(page	353).

Touch was an attribute in the previous edition that measured skin	sensitivity	to	pressure,	texture,	heat,	and	cold;	now,	DEX includes	such	perception.	However,	gamers	could	divide	DEX into	Deftness	(DFT)	and	Touch	(TCH),	similarly	to	the	Perception subattributes.	While	the	optional	table	to	the	right	does	not reflect	this	division,	a	simple	solution	would	be	to	trade	out	all instances	of	DEX	in	the	Craft	Group	for	TCH	(the	more	delicate or	fine	uses	of	the	hands);	and	use	DFT	in	all	the	remaining	SB where	DEX	appears	(the	more	athletic	applications).

If combining these subattribute options with the Attributes Score	Total	Option,	average	EYE/HRG/SML	or	DFT/TCH	into	a single	number	for	determining	the	totals.	Players	may	then distribute	any	received	increases	to	specific,	new	subattributes.
