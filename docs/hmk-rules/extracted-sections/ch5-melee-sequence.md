# Melee Sequence

## 1 engagement

## melee sequence

<!-- image -->

Aware	characters	can	make	a	melee	strike	with	a	readied	weapon against	foes	they	threaten	within	their	Engagement	Zone.

## melee awareness

Combatants	might	have	to	make	an Awareness test	to	notice	foes, such	as	those	newly	engaging	among	a	crowded	group,	or	to	notice anything	while	in	concentration.	The	GM	determines	when	such	tests are	needed.	Combatants	must	Ignore	foes	who	they	are	unaware	of.

## readied weapons

Characters	may	unsheathe	a	weapon	as	a	free	action,	or	unsling	one as a 1-turn Grope action (resheathing/reslinging a weapon is a 1-turn Grope).	Characters	may	drop	items	at	any	time,	requiring	no	action.

## 2 attack &amp; defence declaration

The	character	selecting	the	Attack	option	is	called	the Attacker . The attacker	makes	the	following	declarations	before	the	test:

## target

Designate	the	target	of	the	attack,	called	the Defender .

## strike weapon

Designate	the	readied	weapon	used	in	the	strike.	Decide	on	its	precise Strike	Mode	(page	97	and	page	102);	among	several	factors,	this establishes	the	strike aspect : Blunt [ b ],	Edge	[ e ],	Point	[ p ],	Fire/Frost	[ f ].

## zone options

Identify	the	weapon's	Zone	Die	and	Zone	Aim.

Zone Die :	the	striker's	weapon	determines	the	Zone	Die	(ZD),	such	as d4 ( punch ),	d6	( broadsword , mace ),	or	d8	( spear ).	Natural	weapons	vary in	Zone	Die,	such	as	a	warg's claw (d4)	or	an	old	dragon's bite (d12).

Zone Aim :	the	striker	announces	the	zone	number	(ZN)	aimed	for. The	default	for	medium	size	targets	is	ZN1,	but	can	vary	according	to the	striker's	aim	choice	and	the	size	of	the	target	(step	1,	page	167).

The Defender declares a Melee Defence Option from among the four given	on	the	next	page-Block,	Dodge,	Counterstrike,	or	Ignore.

Blocks require the defender to designate the readied weapon (and its	Strike	Mode)	used	in	the	Block.	When	figuring	the attacker's Reach Penalty	or	Thrust	Bonus	(step	3),	the	defender	may	reference any readied	weapon	(and	its	Strike	Mode)	that	can	threaten	the	attacker, not	simply	the	one	tested	in	the	actual	Block.	Thus,	a	defender	who Blocks	with	a	shield	in	one	hand	may	refer	to	a	readied	spear	in	the other	hand	for	determining	Reach	and	Thrust	modifiers	(step	3).

Dodges still	require	the	designation	of	a	readied	weapon	and	strike mode for determining the attacker's Reach	Penalty	or	Thrust	Bonus,	as for	Blocks.	An	unarmed	defender	may	designate punch, bite ,	or claw .

Counterstrikes target	the	attacker	and	require	the	defender	to declare	Strike	Weapon	and	Zone	Options,	as	above	for	attackers.

## area attacks

Targets	of	an	Area	attack	do	not	declare	a	Defence	Option.	A successful	Area	attack	automatically	engulfs	all	targets	in	its described	area.	Affected	targets	who	choose	the	Evade	action on	an	Initiative	Rank before the	Area	attack	takes	place	can sometimes	mitigate	the	resulting	trauma	(page	166).

a

The term Melee	Strike	is	defined	as	either	1)	a melee Attack against a defender or 2) a counterstrike Defence against	an	attacker.

The	attacker	makes	an	opposed Melee test	against	the	defender's Melee (Block	or	Counterstrike)	or Dodge test.	The	attacker	makes	an unopposed Melee	test	against	a	defender	who	Ignores.	Include	any	of the	following	modifiers	(the symbols	refer	to	page	166): o r t

## aim penalty

Melee	strikers	suffer -10 penalty for	aiming	at	a	non-default	ZN, which	is	ZN1	against	medium	and	smaller	size	targets	(page	167).

## heft penalty

Combatants	suffer -5 penalty for each point their STR is less than the HFT	of	the	weapon	used	in	a	Melee	Strike	or	Block	defence.

Two-handed use :	reduce	HFT	by	5	for	figuring	Heft	Penalty.

Off-handed use :	increase	HFT	by	5	for	figuring	Heft	Penalty (minimum	-10	penalty),	except	for	shields	in	a	Block	or	Press	Attack.

## outnumbered penalty o

Defenders	suffer -10 penalty to defence tests for each opponent threatening	them	beyond	one.	Do	not	count	prone	and	Ignored	foes. See	page	191	for	optional	rules,	such	as	Allies	and	Flanking.

## prone penalty

Prone	combatants	suffer -20 penalty .

## reach penalty r

Combatants	making	a	Melee	Strike	with	a	weapon	whose	Reach (RCH) is less than the	RCH	of	the	weapon	used	by	their	opponent	in the	opposed	Melee	test	suffer	a penalty equal to the difference × 5 . In	Close	(page	171),	the	penalty	goes	to	a higher RCH.

Zone Reach Penalty can	lessen	a	weapon's	RCH	(step	1,	page	167);	if RCH	is	reduced	to	less	than	zero,	the	strike	cannot	be	attempted.

- [ ] thrust bonus t

Combatants	making	a	Melee	Strike	with	a	Thrust	(T)	weapon	whose Reach is greater than the	opponent's	RCH	receive	a bonus equal to the difference × 5 . In Close, the bonus	goes to thrusts	with lower RCH.

## trauma penalty

Combatants	suffer	fatigue	and	applicable	impairment	as	a	penalty.

## 4 outcome

<!-- image -->

Compare	the	attacker's	and	defender's	Success	Levels	and	determine the victory stars (page	61).	The	outcome	varies	by	the	Defence Option-see	the	Attack	and	Defence	Results	on	the	next	page.

Test Failures :	if	both	combatants	fail	in	the	opposed	Melee	test, then	no	strike	occurs	(except	in	the	unopposed	Ignore	defence).	Both parties	are	still	subject	to	their	own	Mishaps	if	they	roll	a	CF.

Test Successes :	a	Block	defence	automatically wins tied	successes, and	a	check	for	Weapon	Damage	is	made	(page	191);	a	Dodge	must have tied successes broken to determine the victor (page 61); and a Counterstrike loses tied	successes.

Injuries :	if	either	combatant	obtains	a	successful	strike,	resolve	with the Injury Sequence (page	167).	After	adjudicating	injury,	apply	other effects	in	the	following	order:	1)	Mishaps	(page	161),	2)	Free	Press Rolls	(page	172	sidebar),	and	3)	Bonus	Action	TA	(page	171).

base impact a	one-star	Strike	means	the	attacker	delivers	a base	impact	strike.	Go	to	Injury	Sequence	(page	167).

tactical advantage each extra star can be a bonus action , extra impact ,	better precision , or a setup (page	171).

tied success the	result	of	a	tied	success	is	determined	by	the defence	option-Block,	Dodge,	or	Counterstrike	(see	below).

base impact one-star	Strike	or	Counterstrike	victory	delivers	the weapon's	base	impact.	Resolve	with	Injury	Sequence	(page	167).

block · dodge a	one-star	Block	or	Dodge	means	the	attack	fails.

tactical advantage each	star	beyond	the	first	grants	one Tactical	Advantage	(TA).	Each	attack	or	defence	option	lists	the available	TA	among	the	four	types	(described	in	full	on		page	171):

action

Take	a	bonus	action,	such	as	Attack	or	Half	Move.

impact

Additional	impact,		usually 3b, 5e, 4p , or 2f .

precision

Roll	an	additional	Zone	Die	and	select	one	result.

setup

Increase a Melee or Dodge test made within the next	round	by	one	success	level.

## tied success

Block:

defender gets	a	one-star	victory	&amp; roll	for	Weapon	Damage	(page	191). higher roll gets	a	one-star	victory. attacker gets	a	one-star	victory.

Dodge:

Counterstrike:

failure if	both	opposed	tests	fail	(F	or	CF),	any	Melee	Strike	fails.

- mishap combatants	make	a	Mishap	Roll	on	a	CF	in	the	Melee	or Dodge	test.	The	type	is	indicated	by	the	ones	die	(see	page	161).

a

Block Example : an ML60 attacker with broadsword rolls 35 (CS) against an ML60 defender's 71 Block roll with broadsword (F). The attacker wins a two-star victory, striking the target with base impact and one TA (one of action, impact, precision, or setup). Impact TA	is	chosen	(+5 e impact).

Dodge Example : an attacker with ML60 rolls 36 (S) against an ML60 defender's	51	Dodge	roll	(S).	For	dodges,	tied	successes	are	broken.	Here,	the defender wins a one-star victory since the defender's 51 roll is higher than the attacker's 37 roll. The attack fails.

Counterstrike Example : an ML60 attacker rolls 36 (S) against an ML60 defender's 51 Counterstrike roll (S). The attacker wins a one-star victory since attackers automatically win tied successes against a counterstrikethere is no	tie	break . The attack does base impact.

Ignore Example : an ML60 attacker with broadsword rolls 36 (S) against a defender who Ignores (no roll). The attacker wins a three-star victory, striking with base impact and two TA. The attacker selects one precision TA (extra	d6	ZD	for	the	broadsword)	and	one impact TA (+5 e) .

## defence result

## block

o

block a	one-star	Block	means	the	attack	fails.

tactical advantage each	extra	Block	star	can	be	a	bonus action or a setup (page	171).

block a	tied	success	means	the	attack	fails;	check	for	Weapon Damage	(page	191).

mishap defender	makes	a	Fumble	(0)	or	Stumble	(5)	Roll,	no matter	the	attacker's	result	(page	161	sidebar).

## dodge

dodge a	one-star	Dodge	means	the	attack	fails.

tactical advantage each extra Dodge star can be a bonus action or a setup (page	171).

tie break an	attacker	who	wins	the	tie	break	delivers	a	base impact	strike.	Go	to	Injury	Sequence	(page	167).	A	defender winning	the	tie	break	means	the	attack	fails.

mishap defender	makes	a	Stumble	Roll,	no	matter	the attacker's	result	(page	161	sidebar).

## counterstrike

base impact a	one-star	Counterstrike	means	the defender delivers	a	base	impact	strike.	Go	to	Injury	Sequence	(page	167).

tactical advantage each	extra	Counterstrike	star	can	be extra impact or better precision (page	171).

## evade action

Characters	who	are	not	stunned	may	select	the	Evade	action	if	they move	at	least	ten	feet	(up	to	half	Move),	stopping	in	threatening	EZ. Throughout	the	turn	and	following	one	round, missile attacks against them	suffer	a	penalty	equal	to	five	times	the	Index	of	their	Dodge EML .	The	evader	may	not	make melee strikes ,	but	Block	and	Dodge normally.	The	evasion	effects	end	if	the	evader	becomes	stunned.

Evading Area Attacks :	in	place	of	the	missile	penalty,	an	evader	tests Dodge	and	reduces	the	Shock	State	Index	of	the	area	attack	by	1	(S)	or	2 (CS).	Whatever	the	test	result,	the	evader	then	becomes	prone.

Defenders	suffer	the	Ignore	defence	when they	1)	are	Unaware	of	attackers	or	2) choose to Ignore	them	(such	a	choice	lasts	one	round).

- The Ignore table	to	the	left	expresses	the attacker's Melee	test.
- Neither Reach Penalty nor Thrust Bonus apply	to	the	attacker's	test.
- Attackers	earn	the	indicated	victory	stars from	their	unopposed	Melee	test.
- Mishaps	affect	the attacker (page	161	sidebar).
