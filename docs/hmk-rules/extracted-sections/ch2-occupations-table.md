## Skills

Whereas Attributes measure innate talent, Skills reflect training and experience. The array of Skills developed in large part defines the character's Persona. While an occupation funnels this development, there is no restriction in the game for 'out-of-character' skill acquisition. A mage can wield weapons; a warrior could be expert in folklore; a scholar might be athletic.

The Skills List table on page 46 displays over 70 distinct skills (see Chapter 3: Skills for detailed descriptions). To complete character generation, players should understand the following key terms.

Skill Base : each skill draws upon the requisite raw talent of two specific Attributes-this is called the Skill Base (SB). The numerical value of the SB equals the average of the given two Attributes. Round a fraction up if the first Attribute listed in the pair is greater than the second; otherwise, round down. The first-listed Attribute is also called the primary Attribute.

Skill Multiple : each skill on the Skills List table has a rating from 0 to 3 called the Skill Multiple (SM). All characters freely receive every listed skill that has an SM of 1 or more. Notice that such automatic skills are already displayed on the character sheet.

Examples : the Melee skill has SM2 listed in the table, so every character may automatically test it. Metalcraft has SM0-it requires development to use.

Mastery Level : skill proficiency is rated from 0 to 100 (or more) and is called Mastery Level (ML). A character's base ML in a skill equals the product of its Skill Base times its Skill Multiple:

Archery 2, Singing 2, Stealth 1, and Survival mastery level (ml) = skill base (sb) × skill multiple (sm)

table. Each result grants the listed skill with

The maximum attainable skill ML equals the character's SB × 7. Chapter 8: Campaign explains skill improvement during the game (page 413).

## skill development

How players develop their character's skills during generation helps tell the PC's life story before the campaign begins.

## skill development stages

Follow these eight stages in order to complete a character's skill development:

## kúzhai folk skills

All Kuzhai characters apply 1 DP to Melee and 3 DP to Languages . They also receive two d10 rolls on following table. Each result grants 2 DP to the given skill (but both rolls resulting in the same skill give 3 DP, not 4).

| d10   | folk skill   | d10   | folk skill    |
|-------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| 1-2   | Engineering2 | 7-8   | Metalcraft 2  |
| 3     | Jewelcraft 2 | 9     | Mineralogy 2  |
| 4     | Lockcraft 2  | 10    | Weaponcraft 2 |
| 5-6   | Masonry 2    |       |               |

## sinái folk skills

All Sinai receive the following Folk DP: Awareness 1, Dancing 3, Languages 5, Melee 1, Archery 2, Singing 2, Stealth 1, and Survival 3. They also receive four d10 rolls on following table. Each result grants the listed skill with the corresponding DP (a duplicate skill result increases its DP by just one).

|   d10 | folk skill     |   d10 | folk skill     |
|-------|----------------|-------|----------------|
|     1 | Ceramics 2     |     6 | Shipwright 2   |
|     2 | Glassworking 2 |     7 | Textilecraft 2 |
|     3 | Jewelcraft 2   |     8 | Timbercraft 2  |
|     4 | Musician 2     |     9 | Weaponcraft 2  |
|     5 | Perfumery 2    |    10 | Woodworking2   |

Skill assignment is done through Development Points ( DP ). When one DP is allocated to a skill, its current SM increases by one. Adding one point to Melee SM2 raises it to SM3; adding one point to Metalcraft SM0 raises it to SM1. The maximum SM allowed is 5, after which each DP improves skills by way of Mastery Boosts (page 47 sidebar).

Follow the stages listed in the sidebar above right to assign a character's skill DP . The Nolora: Skills highlighted section on page 50 provides a complete example of skill assignment.

## [ � ] Folk Skills

Since many Elder Folk have lifespans far greater than humans, and usually spend many decades in adolescence, they develop more automatic skills than humans do. See the sidebar for such Folk Skills granted to Kuzhai and Sinai characters.
