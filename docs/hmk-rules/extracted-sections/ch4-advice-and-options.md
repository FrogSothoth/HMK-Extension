## area armour value

Area	AV	equals	the	sum	of	each	Location's individual	Fire/Frost	AV	times	the	Location's Coverage factor ( cov )-round	up	a	final	sum	with	a fraction	≥	0.30.	Consider	the	Mail	Byrnie	suit:

Skull	(7 × 0.04)	+	Shoulders	(5 × 0.03)	+	Upper	Arms (5 × 0.06)	+	Elbows	(2 × 0.02)	+	Thorax	(5 × 0.12) +	Abdomen	(5 × 0.12)	+	Pelvis	(3 × 0.10)	+	Thighs (1 × 0.14)	+	Knees	(1 × 0.03)	+	Calves	(5 × 0.12)	+	Feet (4 × 0.07)	for	a	total	of	3.32,	rounded	to	Area	AV4.

Quick Area AV :	as	an	optional	calculation,	simply treat	Area	AV	as	equal	to	the Thorax location's F-aspect	AV minus 1 .	This	works	best	when	the	suit offers	coverage	over	most	of	the	body.

| location   |   cov |
|------------|-------|
| Skull      |  0.04 |
| Face       |  0.03 |
| Neck       |  0.02 |
| Shoulders  |  0.03 |
| UpperArms  |  0.06 |
| Elbows     |  0.02 |
| Forearms   |  0.05 |
| Hands      |  0.05 |
| Thorax     |  0.12 |
| Abdomen    |  0.12 |
| Pelvis     |  0.1  |
| Thighs     |  0.14 |
| Knees      |  0.03 |
| Calves     |  0.12 |
| Feet       |  0.07 |

## armour maintenance option

Armour suits require a Maintenance cost per month equal to one percent	of	their	purchase	cost	in	silver	pennies	(d).	Characters	have	an 'armour/clothing	budget'	in	silver	pennies	equal	to	their	Wealth	score each	month	that	automatically	absorbs	the	cost-no	actual	money	is spent	except	for	any	amount	that	exceeds	the	budget.

All	suits	have	an	AQ	equal	to	0	plus	any	bonus	from	Masterwork Rolls	(page	89).	Each	month	the	Maintenance	is	not	paid,	the suit's	AQ	lessens	by	1.	The	GM	may	also	reduce	AQ	due	to	broadly catastrophic	damage	such	as	Area	Fire	or	Frost	impact.	When	a	suit has	AQ	-1	or	lower	the	following	effects	apply:

AQ -1 :	minor	damage;	suit	still	functions.	AQ	can	be	restored	to	its original	maximum	by	spending	10	times	its	Maintenance or receiving a	one-star	result	on	each	crafting	SV	test	pertinent	to	its	materials.

AQ -2 :	major	damage;	reduce	AV	by	one.		AQ	can	be	restored	to	AQ	-1 by	spending	10	times	its	Maintenance and receiving a one-star result on	all	crafting	SV	tests	pertinent	to	its	materials.

AQ -3 :	suit	is	unwearable	unless	remade	at	half	its	original	price.

AQ -4 :	suit	is	unwearable	and	destroyed	beyond	repair.

## face location option

When	the	Face	location	is	struck	in	step	1	of	the	Injury	Sequence (page	167),	roll	d20	to	determine	an	exact facial feature (below left).	Furthermore,	each	d10	Location	Die	(LD)	beyond	the	first	that indicates the Face location grants an extra d20 roll when determining the	facial	feature	(player	chooses	a	result).	Logically	apply	according to	facial	feature	any	compounding	injury	(page	168)	or	unique	injury effects	(page	191	option).	Armour Facial coverage (page 118) can also be specifically	distinguished	(below	right).

| facial feature   | facial feature   | facial feature   | facialcoverage   | facialcoverage   | facialcoverage   | facialcoverage   | facialcoverage   | facialcoverage   | facialcoverage   | facialcoverage   | facialcoverage   |

## kûrbúl and plate armour value option

The	thickness	of	Kurbul	and	Plate	articles	varies	by	the	body	zone covered:	arm	and	leg	pieces	are	thinner	(reduce	AV	by	1	in	all	aspects); helms	are	thicker	(increase	AV	by	1).

## kûrbúl breakage option

Kurbul	cracks	and	eventually	breaks	down.	When	a	location	it protects	suffers	impact	exceeding	the	location's	total	AV,	make	a	d10 roll	against	the	ordinal	instance	of	such	excess,	adding	the	armour's current	AQ	to	the	roll.	The	first	time	AV	is	exceeded,	roll	against	TN1; the	second	time,	TN2;	and	so	forth.	If	less	than	or	equal	to	the	TN, then	the	article	cracks	and	is	destroyed-if	greater,	it	survives.

## metal armour option

Despite	the	Glancing	Blow	rule	(page	168),	metal	armours	are	likely impenetrable to	edge	strikes	that	even	inflict	S2	or	higher	injuriesand	plate	should	be	so	to	point	strikes,	as	well.	Refer	to	the	boxes	in the Armour Value table	(page	111)	when	applying	these	rules:

- Serious and Grievous Edge aspect	injuries	resulting	from	strikes to	a	location	with	at	least	one	layer	of scale or mail instead manifest	as	Blunt	aspect	injuries	of	one	lower	Severity.
- Serious and Grievous Edge and Point aspect injuries resulting from	strikes	to	a	location	with	at	least	one	layer	of plate instead manifest	as	Blunt	aspect	injuries	of	one	lower	Severity.

Thus,	S2	injuries	become	M1 b ; S3 become S2 b; G4,	S3 b; and	G5,	G4 b . With	negative	impact,	apply	the	Metal	Armour	Weapon	Damage rule	(page	191).	Battering	a	plate-armoured	foe	with	a	sword	to	inflict blunt	force	trauma	will	likely	result	in	a	quickly	dulled	blade.

## protection behind hard cover

Targets	behind	hard	barriers	receive	protection	against	strikes	to certain	body	locations.	In	step	1	of	the	Injury	Sequence	(page	167), a	successful	strike	to	a location behind hard cover instead results in no	impact	to	the	target.	Use	common	sense	to	determine	which locations	are	protected	in	this	way.	Consider	a	human-sized	target:

- Kneeling behind a low wall protects	the	abdomen,	pelvis	and	all locations	in	both	legs.
- Leaning out from around a tree deflects	even-numbered	Location Numbers	(LN)	in	the	Torso	zone,	and	all	of	the	one	hidden	leg.

## shield missile block option

The deflect trait	(page	98)	depicts	how	shields	passively	intercept missiles,	whether	wielders	are	aware	of	the	attacks	or	not.	If	wielders are unthreatened in melee (or ignore threats for a round) and are aware of	an	incoming	missile	from	greater	than	half	point	blank	range,	they may	try	an	active	Shield	Missile	Block	defence once per round .	First, resolve	the	Missile	test	using	the	Missile	Sequence	(page	163).	If	it succeeds,	then	the	target	makes	a	Melee	test	with	-20	penalty	plus the	shield's shield mod bonus	(+5	to	+20).	A	CS	deflects	the	missile;	a S	means	it	strikes	the	shield.	Failures	result	in	the	target	being	struck (CF	also	causes	a	Stumble	[CF5]	or	Fumble	[CF0]	Roll	by	the	wielder).

## shield wall option

When	wielding	a	shield	next	to	an	ally	who	has	a	shield	on	the wielder's	non-shield	side,	the	wielder's shield mod and deflect traits increase	by	10	and	2,	respectively	(page	98).	Warriors	in	such	a shield wall may	make	Difficult	half	Moves	(page	160),	but	only	in	consortthey	delay	moving	until	the	turn	of	the	participant	with	the	lowest Initiative	Rank.	A	member	loses	these	benefits	by	moving	out	of	'in close'	range	of	the	allies;	moving	greater	than	a	half	Move;	or	falling prone.	Bucklers	do	not	offer	shield	wall	benefits.
