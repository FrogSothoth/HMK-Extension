# Spirits

## Spirits

A spirit is an entity that naturally inhabits a soul in the spirit world and has no inherent shape in the physical world. Many spirits, such as ghosts, remain forever incorporeal in this way. However, other spirits, such as certain demons, are also capable of existing in the physical world-of becoming corporeal.

Note : the qualities of the spirit world are discussed more fully in the Astral Mysteries section (page 289).

## incorporeal spirits

All spirits are naturally incorporeal-they inhabit an active soul with perspective in the spirit world. As incorporeals, spirits have the following characteristics.

Active Soul : the spirit may take spirit actions in the astralscape.

Attributes : incorporeal entities have only mental attributes, which can include Morality (MOR).

Trauma : only mental trauma affects spirits.

Dissolution : when suffering from dissolution, the spirit may not take spirit actions. Dissolution lasts for days, varying according to the source. While dissolved, the spirit's soul effectively 'disappears' in the astralscapeother entities cannot interact with it.

Possession : an active soul with no natural shape may engage in spirit conflict with the souls of entities in an attempt to gain control of their bodies in the physical world-this is called possession (page 297). Since doing so is risky, and some consider it immoral, many spirits refrain from attempting possession.

Animation : an active soul may try to control an object in the physical world-this is called animation (page 297).

The nature of Kelestia does not easily fit predictable classification. Consider these abnormalities.

Ether-corporeal : due to rifts between the astralscape and landscape, some spirits inhabit the spirit world and physical world at the same time. See the exoticand quite dangerous-Da Anchen (page 395).

Manifestation : some spirits can produce sensory phenomena in the physical world while remaining incorporeal in the spirit world. This is not incarnation but rather what is called manifestation. See the Ghost entry (page 396) as an example.

Semi-corporeal : the Lyahvi spell Passage (page 235) allows a mage to exhibit some incorporeal features while still actually inhabiting the body.

## corporeal spirits

While all spirits are naturally incorporeal, some of them can become corporeal-that is, they can exist temporarily in the physical world. Some do so through possession. Others achieve it through incarnation . The Bestiary entries identify which process spirits prefer.

## Incarnation

Incarnation is to spirits what-in reverse-astral travel is to mortal folk: a way to transcend their normal state of existing. Whereas astralists from the physical world are able to inhabit their souls in the spirit world, incarnated spirits can inhabit a kind of 'body' in the physical worldcalled a form . The form gives them perspective in the physical world and allows them to touch and be touched by other beings and objects. In all respects, the form is actually 'there' in the physical world.

Incarnated spirits have the following characteristics.

Dormant Soul : incarnated spirits may not take spirit actions in the astralscape. They may make Spirit tests in response to opposing Spirit Conflict, but they are not considered Native Souls while incarnate.

If an incarnated spirit suffers soul dissolution, its incarnation is dramatically destroyed-it burns to cinders; explodes in a puff of smoke; or crumbles to dust.

Attributes : incarnated spirits can have both physical and mental attributes.

Trauma : physical and mental trauma affect incarnated spirits similarly to physical beings. Their form usually mimics all of a living body's physiological functions, such as bleeding and unconsciousness. Exceptions are noted.

When an incarnated spirit suffers a KIA Shock State, they lose their form in the same dramatic way as described above. The spirit then immediately reinhabits its soul in the spirit world and suffers dissolution for usually 3d6 days (the duration can differ according to the entity).

Arcane Defence : some incarnated spirits are only affected by magic weapons and incantations. These spirits do not suffer physical trauma. Instead, they test Spirit to avoid dissolution when so 'injured'. Specific entries will note this special case.

Duration : a spirit remains incarnated until it is 'killed' (above) or until some other limitation is reached. With arcanely summoned spirits, the temporary incarnation ends when the spell ends. Some spirits are incarnated at the whim of an entity in the spirit world, as with certain demons. Other spirits, such as the troublesome Asiri, completely control their own incarnation. Each entry addresses such unique qualities.

## asîr Air Sprite

3"-12" tall

When the mischievous Asiri incarnate in the physical world, they usually take flying form as either a near-opaque haze or diaphanous faerie shape. In either case, an Asir ranges from just a few inches to no more than a foot tall.

Asiri are attracted to enchantments and, if incorporeal, will engage in Spirit Conflict to possess the person or artefact with the highest Aura or Ego. The greater the enchantment's power, the more aggressive their behaviour. They like to lie in wait within mundane objects. Also known as air sprites , they sometimes form tribes of up to a dozen.

Emote : the Asir must sense a target's soul from the Spirit World (page 295). Then, with a successful Emote test, it instills in a target an emotion (such as jealousy, love, doubt) or a sunsign personality trait. The target resists the effect with a higher opposed Spirit test (break ties).

Duration: d6 hours per Asir star victory.

Enthral : as the Arcane Talent of the same name (page 261). The Asir must be incarnate to invoke it.

## aúlamith Dream Bearer

1' tall

Aulamithri are spirit servants of the deity Siem. They take form in the physical world as faerie-like humanoids less than a foot tall. They have colourful, delicate wings, the size of which increases in proportion to their Aura score.

When mortals experience a Lucid Dream, an Aulamith is sent to inform their soul in the spirit world. The Dream Bearer then often incarnates near the sleepers in order to protect their bodies during the astral dream journey. If the sleeper's body is threatened, an Aulamith can use its scratch and bite against foes to inflict bad luck and mental disorders.

Aura Bolt : as the Arcane Talent Elemental Bolt (page 261). The Aulamith must be incarnate to invoke it.

Bite : a penetrating bite gives the target three levels of psyche stress (PSY 3). This is recovered as Mental Trauma; or dispelled as a CL III Neutral enchantment.

Enthral : as the Arcane Talent of the same name (page 261). The Aulamith must be incarnate to invoke it.

Incarnation : Asiri may incarnate as a free action on their turn. Observers must successfully test Awareness to see their form even in full light (CS in dim light).

When seen, an Asir tests dodge to avoid attacks and has but two-ZN in its Body Location table. Only enchanted weapons or spells that would otherwise injure it have an effect. If so struck or affected, the Asir must successfully test Spirit or lose incarnation and suffer dissolution for d6 days (CF 3d6 days).

Incarnation : Aulamithri incarnate as a free action on their turn. During a full moon-the 15th of every month-viewers can clearly see them. On other days, a viewer must test Awareness (-5 penalty per furthest day before or after the 15th).

Scratch : a scratch curses the target with bad luck. The victim makes a d10 roll versus TN6 with all tests-failure reduces the accompanying test's success level by one. The victim overcomes the curse with a Spirit test success (one try per d6 days). It may also be dispelled (CL 3 Neutral).

BESTIARY 7

SPIRITS

## dâ ânchen Eldest Ones

ether-corporeal

The Eldest Ones appear in places where the veil between the spirit and physical worlds is torn. Some speculate they come from the evil plane of Durathrhor or perhaps are vestigial servants of the Earthmasters. Whatever their origin, they inhabit remote shadowy dells and damp cold valleys. Usually encountered only at night, the Da Anchen have recently terrified wilderness travellers during cloudy days, most famously among the Jerinalian Mountains of Emelrene.

Ether-Corporeal : appearing as inky masses about five feet in diameter, Eldest Ones simultaneously inhabit the spirit and physical worlds. This allows them to select from both spirit and physical actions on any given round.

ER SEQUENCE

4

- Moving : Eldest Ones can seep through all beings and objects with Move 10 (or Move 90 if agitated-see sidebar).

ACTIONS

Perceiving : they use Spirit Sensing to locate a physical target from the impression the being or object makes in the spirit world. This tests EML70 plus the target's own AUR Modifier.

Gloom : Da Anchen so strongly exude darkness principle that they project a gloom into the physical world. It surrounds them in a 500-foot radius and reduces the emanation of all light. Sunshine is muted; forests turn dim; a moonlit night is utterly black.

Image : viewers must succeed on an Awareness test to see Eldest Ones in muted light, or a CS in dim shadow. They cannot be seen in darkness.

Malaise : targets who are able to see an Eldest One may try to dodge its deathly cold touch attack. A G4 or G5 injury from this clammy malaise also ages the target d6 years per IL. A Spirit test by the target eliminates 2 (S) or 4 (CS) of the d6.

Negation (Charge/Attack action): a touch and successful Negation test extinguishes natural flames and dispels magic light or fire. Eldest Ones never suffer fatigue, but a CF causes Talent Misfire (page 260).

Duration: 10 minutes (CS Indefinite)

Suffocation : if an Eldest One strikes a target in the Head or Thorax zone and gains a TA, it may use it to induce asphyxia (page 183). Once per minute thereafter, victims may try to end the asphyxia with a successful Spirit test.

Vulnerabilities : Aural Shock causes dissolution. Enchanted metals affect Da Anchen although they may try to dodge weapons. If struck, they must test Spirit successfully or dissolve for d6 days (CF 3d6). Water/Cold, Earth, Fire, and Light have no effect. They shun clear sunlight.

Characters	who	failed	the	Empathy	test	in step 3 face Lucid Nightmares during their sleep	for	the	next	2d6	days.	Each	night a d20 roll is made on the Lucid Dream table	(page	292).	A	positive	entry	result equals the duration in rounds of a Lucid Nightmare,	with	the	following	effects:

- An	Eldest	One	appears	in	the	dreamer's astralscape locale and initiates a Spirit Conflict attack	each	round.	The	dreamer receives	the	Native	Soul	bonus.
- If	the	Eldest	One	wins,	the	dreamer suffers	2	PSY	levels	per	star-but no	Aural	Shock-and	then	makes	a Reembodiment	Roll.	Lucid	Nightmare checks	are	then	repeated	each	night.
- If	the	character	wins	a	Spirit	Conflict just once ,	the	Eldest	One	is	driven	off. This	ends	the	nightmares,	no	matter how	much	remains	of	the	2d6	period.

## ghost

incorporeal

A ghost is the spirit of a being who suffers great mental trauma at the moment of death. Rather than passing to the afterlife, a ghost remains in the astralscape close to where it died in the physical world. The motive for doing so varies: to right a wrong, to assuage guilt, to seek revenge. The ghost's Morality and Personality traits greatly affect its motivation and actions.

Manifestation (1-turn): although incapable of incarnation, a ghost may create phenomena in the physical world by making a Spirit Success Value test on the Manifestation table. The SV attained reflects the most intense or strangest effect possible-the ghost can choose to manifest something weaker. See the italicised examples for inspiration.

A being in the physical world who witnesses the effect makes a Fear Roll (page 187) with the given modifier.

While the Manifestation Roll always produces some sort of result, an actual Failure (F) on the Spirit SV test means the ghost cannot roll again for 3d6 hours,

## ghost [shade]

incorporeal

A type of ghost, a shade is the soul of a being who is no longer anchored to a body in the physical world but who has also not passed on to the afterlife. Shades inhabit the astralscape but have avoided the anguish that might have turned them into a typical ghost. They can arise out of various circumstances, such as the four examples to the right.

Spirit Actions : shades do not have the ability for incarnation or manifestation and may only take actions in the spirit world. Given their inability to or decision not to pass on to the afterlife, shades still retain some interest in the physical world. For this reason they are more likely than regular ghosts to undertake possession or animation (page 297).

Wilful Shade : at death the souls of beings usually automatically begin their Afterlife journey (page 298 sidebar). Characters from a shamanic tradition may make a Trance SV test at the moment of death. An SV9 or more gives them the option to remain in the astralscape as a wilful shade (see Ancestor Spirit, right).

When the being died, the soul wilfully remained in the astralscape as an ancestor spirit. Tribal shamans make spirit journeys to petition the shade for powers. An ancestor spirit would also have several other high skill MLs-specific ones varying by culture.

Upon death, the souls of some beasts remain in the astralscape as a wilful shade similar to an Ancestor Spirit. The above shade is such a wolf spirit. Animal spirits often grant totem powers to shamanic astralists, and they can also form a soul-connection with folk who have the Transmutation talent.

Spirit Actions : ghosts may only take actions in the spirit world. They can use Spirit Sensing to locate a specific being in the physical world who encroaches on their haunted territory. The test likely includes penalties from the target being dormant (-20) and unfamiliar (-20).

Ghosts usually have a Hostile estrangement against others who target them with Spirit Communing .

Particularly malevolent ghosts might attempt possession of a being's body through Spirit Conflict .

the Shadow and chose to vacate its body rather than become an Amorvrin or pass to the afterlife. With a body now controlled by Morgathians as a Dalmorvrin, the spirit's motivation for possession or animation will greatly vary according to morality and personality.

This type of shade arises when its body dies through Navehan ritual suicide. If ritually summoned by a Navehan priest, this so-called 'demon' can be commanded to possess or animate from the astralscape a body or object in the physical world.

## gytévsha

incorporeal

The Gytevshai are demonic spirits who do the bidding of Naveh, the god of darkness and death. Religious doctrine teaches that Naveh did not create the Gytevshai but rather harnessed them from the 'void'. Since a Gytevsha cannot incarnate in the physical world, it instead assails victims through spirit conflict. Priests of the Navehan religion have developed arcane rituals to summon and command them to torment enemies of the church. Some Gytevshai also seem to harass mortals all on their own, perhaps at the whim of Naveh himself.

## greater gytévshai

The most powerful Gytevshai are three unique demons named Gekrish , Krasula , and Vesha .

Gékrish : known as the Hands of Despair , Gekrish is most often sent to punish Naveh's unfaithful. He usually possesses and torments their body, and then 'stills the heart with talon-hands', literally killing victims through cardiac arrest.

Krasúla : the Hunter of Sleep delivers traumatising nightmares. He can also project into the physical world an unsettling image of a child with one pale blue eye and one dark black eye.

Vésha : the Mouth of Falsehood sows deceit and confusion. Victims hear Vesha's commands as whispers in their ear, dark missives encouraging dark acts.

## lesser gytévshai

More numerous are the servitor spirits of Gekrish, Krasula, and Vesha. They have less powerful versions of the very same abilities expressed by their respective Greater Gytevsha superiors.

## devout shade

The monthly Navehan ceremony called Dezenaka sometimes includes the voluntary suicide of an aged priest. Upon dying they often choose to remain in the afterlife as a type of ghost called a shade (page 396). They roam the astralscape close to their home temple, often answering ritual summonings like the Gytevsha. Although colloquially called 'demons', devout shades lack the following unique Gytevsha powers and so torment only through possession.

## gytévsha powers

Both Greater and Lesser Gytevshai are natural spirits-active souls in the astralscape. Except when temporarily dissolved, Gytevshai may take one of the five spirit actions (page 294) each turn.

Gytevshai torment souls by targeting them in Spirit Conflict. If victorious, in addition to causing dissolution, the demon has the option to express a power unique to its Gytevsha type:

| type    | powers                   |
|---------|--------------------------|
| gékrish | possession • still heart |
| krasúla | nightmare• manifestation |
| vésha   | confusion • deceit       |

The same demon may express each such optional power only once per victim per day, and only one per round of conflict.

Confusion : the demon inflicts two Psyche Stress levels (PSY) per victory star of the spirit conflict. Targets acquire the psyche trait called confused . Whenever the victim wishes to choose an action or make a decision, the GM rolls d10 against TN8 (Greater Gytevsha) or TN5 (Lesser). A success means the victim chooses to Pass, briefly hesitating. During recovery (page 189), victims have -5 penalty per MOR below 8; or +5 bonus per MOR above 13.

Deceit : as for Confusion, except the psyche trait is deceitful . Whenever victims face a decision, a successful d10 roll against TN8 (Greater) or TN5 (Lesser) means their Morality score is halved while making the decision.

Manifestation : the demon makes a Spirit SV test to create an image, seen only by the victim, of a male child's face with one pale-blue eye and one deep black eye. Resolve like a Ghost's Manifestation ability but include the Aberrance  of Lesser (ABE 1) and Greater Gytevshai (ABE 3).

Nightmare : the demon inflicts 2 Psyche Stress levels (PSY) per victory star of the spirit conflict. The nightmare's accompanying trait is determined randomly (page 188).

Possession : the demon possesses the target's body (page 297).

Still Heart : the victim makes an Endurance test as a Shock Roll against SHK 8 (Greater Gytevsha); or SHK 7 (Lesser). Resolve with step 4.3 of the Injury Routine (page 169).

## place energy Lællyn

ether-corporeal zone

While not living entities, place energy widely exists in the astralscape and so is discussed here in the Spirit section of the Bestiary.

Place Energy is a large category of phenomena that inhabit simultaneously both the spirit and physical worlds. The Emelrene region contains the greatest variety of these ether-corporeal zones, often there called lællyn . Most exude a connection with a principle element-Earth, Metal, Fire, Air, Aura, or Water. Astralists who undertake Spirit Immersion in the zones experience Sunsign Intensification , as explained in the Astral Journey Routine (page 296).

Place Energy is so powerful that simply being within its boundary in the physical world has the same intensifying effect: creatures increase their positive Sunsign modifiers by 5 or decrease their negative ones by 5 in relation to the zone's principle element. See the Sunsign Modifiers table (page 22).

Place Energy is greatly variable in nature, but only three types are detailed hereAmbient Fields , Ethereal Rivers , and Temporal Zones . Even these are not exhaustive categories, as most exhibit unique characteristics. Note the example at the end of each kind's section.

## Ambient Fields

Place Energy associated with Air, Earth, Fire, or Water is sometimes so strong that it allows for shamanic petitioning from the physical world. A shaman can make the petition for an Energy Spirit Power from within the boundaries of such an ambient field by following these steps:

[�] Time : 10 minutes of concentration.

[�] Power Anima : the shaman selects a power (I, II, or III), but the level cost is doubled (2, 4, or 6). The power so drawn from an ambient field is not stored like those gained from an astral journey, but the shaman still must have the unstored Spirit Index to cover its higher level cost.

[�] Test : the shaman tests Spirit (Trance SR) on the Energy Wielding table (page 305). A failed Trance SR decreases the Spirit success level by one.

[�] Wielding : if successful, the shaman gains and then must immediately wield the power. There is no opportunity to 'store' it for later wielding.

## the high vale

More	properly	called	the High	Vale	of Our Mothers ,	this	ambient	Earth	field	is revered	by	the	tribal	Kath	of	central	Hârn. Located	west	of	Tashal	in	the	Kathela	Hills, the	field	attracts	their	people's	wandering shamans,	who	come	to	petition	for	readily enhanced	foraging	skill.

Fog :	a	shaman	making	an	ambient petition	amid	a	foggy	morning	may	select a	Water	power	instead.

## Ethereal Rivers

This kind of Place Energy flows in the astralscape along the same course as a physical river in the landscape. Not all rivers possess such spirit world 'mimics'; and sometimes ethereal rivers exist where there is no longer a corresponding physical one-or at least no longer a visible one at ground level.

Physical World : folk travelling by boat or raft on a physical river connected to an ethereal one automatically intensify their sunsign according to Water principle. Those actually submerged in the river-either swimming on or under its surface-increase the corresponding modifier effect by plus or minus 10.

Spirit World : souls taking Spirit Roaming actions increase by one success level the Spirit (Creativity) test when travelling from one astral locale on an ethereal river downstream to another one. They are similarly penalised going upstream. Spirit Immersion within the ethereal river has its usual benefits.

## meldeláras-lællyn

This	ethereal	river	flows	along	the	course of the Yuvra river in northern Emelrene and	empties	into	the	Hedegu	Vortex	in Quandas	Bay	over	50	miles	downstream. Spirit Roaming along the Meldelaras makes	Astral	Drift	especially	difficult to	overcome	(-20	penalty).	Moreover,	a Critical	Failure	on	the	Creativity	test	to shake	off	Astral	Drift	means	the	soul	is automatically	swept	into	the	Hedegu Vortex,	whose	egress	has	yet	to	be documented.

## Temporal Zones

Some Place Energy distorts the passage of time, either slowing it down or speeding it up compared to the rate outside.

Physical world : spending one round in a slow zone might see two minutes pass outside (one hour equals one day). Slow zones can be quite large-up to a dozen square miles-and they often intensify Water or Earth principle.

Quick zones distort time to a similar, but inverted extent. They seem to be rarer than slow zones but are of a similar size. Quick zones often intensify Fire or Air principle.

Spirit world : Spirit Roaming in an astral locale within a slow zone carries a -20 penalty; doing so within a fast zone has a +20 bonus. Spirit Immersion within temporal zones has its usual benefits.

## ábrela-lællyn

Located in the Jerinalian Mountains of Emelrene,	Abrela-lællyn	is	a	severe	slow zone	in	which	only five seconds seem to pass	for	every month that does outside (Spirit	Roaming	carries	a	-60	penalty). A vault about a half mile within its boundary	houses	artefacts	and	texts sacred	to	the	tribal	Emhle.	The	zone	helps reduce	the	decay	of	these	items	and	also dissuades	idle	exploration-a	year	passes outside	for	every	minute	spent	within	it.

The Savoryan Barasi al Kynvallwyn ('the Far Sighted') speculated that the filaments that connect two eponymous correspondence points are ethereal life forms . They seem to come into existence, exhibit a tendency to undulate, and then expire as a natural process. They express a certain volition in how they seek to attach their ends to similar terminus locations. The Melderyni mage Kemdalwyn al Manawydan developed the Gate spell to 'hijack' an anchored end of a Fixed filament and force it to seek out a new terminus as visualised. The now Semifixed filament attaches itself to a string of Unfixed and Semi-fixed filaments in an attempt to guide the series as close as possible to a terminus that best matches the mage's mental projection. The process is quite stressful on the filaments.

## v'hîr Agrikan demons

incarnated

The spirits known as the V'hiri are the brutal and warlike servants of the god Agrik. They are stratified into seven orders below the supremacy of the deity himself. Theoretically, each successive group consists of eight times the number in the previous one:

interdimensional portal, or summoned

| order   | v'hîr      | number    |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| 2nd     | ar'v'hîr   | 8         |
| 3rd     | tan'v'hîr  | 64        |
| 4th     | su'ûra     | 512       |
| 5th     | hesa v'hîr | 4,096     |
| 6th     | ban'v'hîr  | 32,768    |
| 7th     | vayêra     | 262,144   |
| 8th     | vii        | 2,097,152 |

The 2nd order are also known as the eight Sons of Agrik, often mistakenly called by mortals as simply 'V'hiri'. While strength and ability decrease with each lesser order, all exhibit a near-equal fearlessness and passion for violence.

BESTIARY

SPIRITS

Flight : the leathery wings of V'hiri allow for cumbersome flight from the ground. With a leap from at least 50 feet up, they may achieve a brief, faster glide (triple Move score for six rounds).

Incarnation : V'hir do not have control over their own incarnation. They are either sent forth by Agrik through some interdimensional portal, or summoned by an arcanist. The demons lose form if they suffer KIA Shock or-if summonedwhen the spell ends. In either case, their soul is then dissolved for d100 days.

Language : V'hir have fluency in the Agrikan temple tongue called Surikal (Index equals half ELO, rounded up).

Molten Ash : V'hir that lose form explode in a shower of molten ash. Creatures within a distance equal to the demon's height suffer an Area Attack from its Fire impact. Aware creatures who successfully test Dodge reduce the resulting Injury Severity by 1 (S) or 2 (CS).

under overcast skies or in twilight.

Whether sent forth from the hellish fortress of Balgashang or summoned by Agrikan priests, the seven orders of V'hiri incarnate similarly in the physical world. They appear as bipedal humanoids with cloven hooves, scalloped wings, and deadly claws. They have a black, squamous hide, as if hardened like cold magma. Literally shrouded in shadow and fire, all V'hiri wield weapons favoured by their master-metal-barbed whips, heavy maces, and sickle-shaped swords. While in single battle mortal folk can sometimes defeat members of the weaker orders, the eight Sons exude a fell power insuperable to all but the mightiest Kethiran.

Blood of Agrik : V'hiri have blood akin to oozing magma, and they can suffer Shock from bleeding. V'hir blood that touches a creature inflicts the demon's Fire impact (see V'hir Abilities table, next page).

Flame : V'hir bodies and weapons are enveloped in dancing flame. A successful weapon attack inflicts the listed Fire impact to the very same location struck, rolled separately as its own burn injury. Bonus Impact TA apply only to the weapon aspect's impact. Burn injuries do not compound with weapon aspect injuries-but both can compound with themselves over successive strikes.

Opponents who are victorious with an unarmed attack or defence against a V'hir also suffer its fire impact to the zone they used in the test (in a random location).

## issued v'hîri

Although Agrik is said to send forth V'hiri on his own from time to time, scholars do not understand who or what really commands them. These V'hiri incarnate in the world by way of various types of Gateway forces.

## summoned v'hîri

The arcane mystery Agrikan priests practice to summon V'hiri works by way of similar Gateway force. The summoner wields a precarious command over such demons; those known to have broken free express a rage severe for even their nature.

Shadow Cloak : a semi-corporeal shadow surrounds V'hiri. In dim light or darkness they receive +20 bonus to Stealth tests.

Vayéra and Vii : the 7th and 8th order V'hiri fear daylight. They suffer -20 penalty to Initiative and Morale tests when in broad daylight; or -10 penalty under overcast skies or in twilight.

*	Use	the	same	F-impact	Armour	Value	for	Area	AV	(Shock	6).

## encounter sequence

<!-- image -->

## aberrance

Upon	seeing	a	V'hir,	characters	make	a Fear	Roll.	Include	the	effect	of	the	demon's Aberrance	1-4	(page	187).

<!-- image -->

## melee attack

V'hiri	engage	the	nearest	foe	with	a	Charge using	the	primary	weapon	(sword	or	mace).

<!-- image -->

## melee defence

V'hiri	always	choose	the	Counterstrike defence,	even	the	weaker	Orders.

- In	open	space,	they	counterstrike	with their	off-hand whips ;	in	close	quarters, they	counterstrike	with mace or claw .

<!-- image -->

## morale

V'hiri	of	the	2nd	to	6th	orders	never	suffer	a Morale trigger from group cohesion (page 162).	The	7th	and	8th	orders	do	so	only during	daylight,	twilight	(-10	penalty),	or overcast	days	(-20	penalty).

<!-- image -->

When	6th	and	7th	Order	V'hir	face	upright	human-sized	targets,	resolve	their	strikes on the Gârgún vs Human table in the other column	(page	371).	V'hir	of	the	8th	Order similarly	use	the arák column	of	the	same	table.	All	other	Orders	roll	on	the	core	table on	page	167.
