action movement

defence

aim (bow) :	the	aim	action	with	a	bow	is	allowed	only	if	Pull exceeds	Draw	by	at	least	75	(see	Draw	entry,	page	108).

charge :	character	may	make	a	Thrown	weapon	attack	at	a target	at	least	five	feet	away	after	the	Charge	movement.

load : assumes arrows or bolts are in a quiver or arrow bag ; or sling stones are in a belt pouch .	If	projectiles	are	in	hand,		or readily	accessible	nearby,	then	load	time	is	a	free	action (some	situations	might	require	a	successful	DEX	or	Missile test,	archer's	choice,	to	make	it	a	free	action).

span :	by	hand,	the	time	is	1	round.	Using	a	mechanical spanner	takes	2,	4,	or	8	rounds	(page	108).	After	spanning, loading	a	bolt	requires	the	separate	Load	action.

half move : a	shooter	suffers	the	Shooter	Moving	penalty	in step	3,	whether	movement	is	before	or	after	the	shot.

Actions	that	induce	the	Ignore	defence	may	be	abandoned	by aware	combatants	in	order	to	defend	normally.

## missile range

The	range	to	the	target	determines	whether	the	missile	attack	has	a nearly	straight	( Direct) or high arcing ( Volley )	trajectory.

## 3 missile test

<!-- image -->

To	resolve	the	test,	consider	target	movement	and	missile	skill.

## target movement

The target of a missile test is considered still , moving ,	or evading .	Here are some examples to help the GM adjudicate this status:

Still : shooting a missile weapon; standing guard; casting a spell; moving	stealthily	or	walking	(half	Move).

Moving :	charging	(half	Move);	running	(up	to	double	Move).

Evading :	actively	fighting	in	melee;	performing	the	Evade	action.

## missile skill

The	ML	used	in	the	missile	attack	varies	according	to	weapon	type:

| Bow                   | ArcheryML                        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Crossbow              | ArcheryMLorEMLequaltoArcherySB×3 |
| Sling                 | SlingsML                         |
| Thrown objectorweapon | ThrowingML                       |

Apply	situational	modifiers	to	the	test	EML:

| situation              | modifier                                   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Still Target           | 0                                          |
| Moving Target          | -10 penalty                                |
| Evading Target         | Effective DodgeIndex×5penalty (page 79)    |
| Moving Shooter         | -10 penalty (does not apply to throwers)   |
| Thrown Weapon/Object   | Heft penalty (page 98 and 110)             |
| Thrown Object          | -10 penalty (-20 penalty if oblong)        |
| Crosswind (Direct)     | -10 penalty per Windforce (2-4)            |
| Crosswind (Volley)     | -20penalty per Windforce (1-4)             |
| Trauma                 | Fatigue penalty and applicable Impairment  |
| Aim                    | +10 bonus if took Aimaction previous round |
| Point Blank Range      | +10 bonus                                  |
| Massive Target (TAR2+) | +5 bonus per TAR(Direct and Direct PBonly) |

Precipitation :	if	kept	dry,	bows	and crossbows	are	not	affected	by	rain	over the	short	course	of	typical	one-	or	twominute	skirmishes.	For	longer	periods,	or if	the	GM	deems	equipment	wet,	simply halve	their	Base	Range	(BR)	characteristic.

## missile attack resolution

Resolve the test according to whether it is a Direct or Volley attack	(next	page);	or	a lobbed	'grenade'	(page	110).

Spoiled Attack :	if	missile	attackers have	a	final	adjusted	EML	of	-40	or worse,	then	the	attack	is	spoiled, and the minimum EML05 test	roll	is	not	allowed. Depending on the source of such penalties, either no attack	takes place	(the	action	is	wasted),	or the	attack	occurs	but	automatically	fails (roll	against	EML05	to	check	for	CF).

## direct missile attack

The	attacker	makes	a	missile	attack	at	a single target .

Zone Die :	attackers	use	the	Zone	Die	(ZD)	according	to	range,	as determined	in	step	2	(page	163).

Zone Aim : the shooter then chooses which Zone Number (ZN) on the target's Body Location table	to	aim	for	with	the	ZD.	The	ZD	result begins	on	this	number	and	counts	up.	Thus,	the	roll	of	a	d6	ZD	aimed at	ZN3	starts	the	count	at	ZN3	and	ends	at	ZN8	(3	→	4	→	5	→	6	→	7	→	8);	a roll	of	4	would	result	in	a	ZN6	strike.	See	step	1	of	the	Injury	Sequence (page	167)	for	more	details	about	Zone	Aim.

Resolve the test according to whether the target is Still or Moving/ Evading ,	as	defined	in	Missile	step	3.	Attackers	earn	the	indicated victory	stars	from	this	unopposed	test:

Resolve	the	strike	using	the	Injury	Sequence	(page	167).	Use a	d10	ZD	or	a	die	whose	size	equals	the	target's	number	of	body zones,	if	larger.	Adjust	the	base	impact	by	range	(step	2);	if	the	d10 rolled	with	the	d20	is	a	5	or	0,	add	the	projectile's	Impact	TA	bonus.

impact precision

Increase	strike	impact	according	to	the	weapon.

When	determining	the	attack's	injury	location, roll an additional Zone Die and choose one result to	apply	(Injury	Sequence,	step	1,	page	167).

Direct Missile Example : Nolora has Archery ML75 and takes a direct shot from	point	blank	range	(+10	bonus)	versus	a	still	target.	This	uses	a	d6	Zone Die,	and	she	aims	for	ZN 1.	With	EML85,	the	roll	is	45-CS.	This	gives	a	base impact strike; an extra Precision TA; and one TA of choice. She selects another Precision	TA,	producing	a	total	of	three	d6	ZD	rolls.

If	the	d20	roll	does	not	indicate	a	hit,	then	the	attack	misses.

- volley precision when	determining	a	potential	strike	against the	target	count,	roll	d10	instead	of	d20.	With	each	step	beyond	CS, roll	an	additional	d10	(attacker	selects	a	single	d10	result	to	apply).

Volley Missile Example : during a surprise round, Nolora shoots her bow from	500-foot	volley 3	range	(-20)	at	a	15-foot	space	of	ground	containing five brigands, one of whom is mounted. With her Archery ML75, a light crosswind	(-20)	and	still	targets	(0),	the	test	is	against	EML35.	A	25	is rolled-CS, a Potential Strike with Volley Precision.

The Potential Strike puts the shot in the intended area. The target count is seven, one for each brigand plus two for the horse. Nolora's player rolls 7 on the d10 for Volley Precision; and rolls 2 on the other d10 for special impact. The 7 indicates a strike to the horse (the GM numbered it as counts 6 and 7); and the 2 indicates no bonus Impact TA.

The	player	rolls	the	Location	Roll	for	the	strike	with	a	d20	Zone	Die, based on the number of zones the destrier has (Table c , page 355); along with the d10 Location Die. Respective rolls of 14 and 4 indicate a strike to the horse's	flank.	The	heavy-shafted	bodkin	arrow's	impact	is	d12 + 4	from	the DRW100 bow; reduced by 3 from the range; with the projectile's Armour Reduction 4 eliminating all of the destrier's AV3. The impact is determined by	rolling	d12 + 1-a	final	7	inflicts	an	S2 p injury to the horse.

With arrow in hand, Nolora reloads as a free action and, at IR76, shoots before the soldiers' IR60 next round. A roll of 16 against the same EML35 means a Potential Strike. A d20 is rolled against the target count seven, but a 14 indicates a miss (and so the d10 Impact TA roll is moot).
