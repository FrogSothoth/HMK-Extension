The newest edition of N. Robin Crossby's HârnMaster makes roleplaying in his medieval fantasy world of Kèthîra easier than ever before. Keléstia Productions now connects more fully Crossby's legacy of detailed maps and world material to specific game rules tailored to the setting-for characters, skills, possessions, exploring, seafaring, artefacts, combat, magic, miracles, mysticism, and beasts. From the legendary island of Hârn to the vibrant lands beyond its horizon, Kèthîra is a realistic world of intricate politics, logical economies, vivid cultures, ancient secrets, and uncommon dangers-the perfect home to challenge the restless adventurer.

- Twelve Attributes describe fully a character's physical and mental talent.
- Over 70 Skills measure a character's aptitude through knack and training.
- Dozens of Occupations reflect all manner of pursuits, from the mundane to the martial and esoteric.
- A rich social tapestry demands subtle intrigue for those trying to influence it.
- Wilderness treks and sea voyages lead to deep mysteries and bizarre denizens.
- Secretive mages called the Shèk-Pvâr wield powerful, yet fraught magic.
- Mystic shamans enter trances to inhabit their souls on astral journeys.
- Both mental and physical trauma can leave deep marks; specific injuries are defined by exact locations and severity.
- The faithful inspire others through ritual ceremony, while deities remain aloof to all but the few in a state of grace.
