## Seafaring

Journeys of great distance often involve sailing. Due to the current state of vessel design and navigation technique, Kethiran shipmasters usually remain within sight of shore and limit seafaring to a handful of days. The following Voyage Routine allows for a quick assessment of common ventures, such as trips between Hârn and the Lythian mainland or excursions among Karejian islands.

## crew

First, compute, select, or randomly generate on the table below a special group Seafaring ML . This equals the average of all the crew's individual Seamanship skills plus the Secondary Modifier of the navigator's Pilot skill.

| seafaringml   | seafaringml   |
|---------------|---------------|
| d100          | ml            |

| 96-00         | 89+d10        |

## vessels

Next, identify the vessel from the selection given in the table below. Ships are grouped geographically: those that predominate in the North (the Sea of Ivae and Gulf of Eder); or in the South (the Venarian Sea and tropics). See Chapter 4: Possessions (page 123) for more details.

Size ( siz ): an index of displacement volume (also called gross burthen), roughly the cube root of a hundredth the product of length, beam, and depth (in feet).

Hull ( hul ): a composite index that combines volume of displacement and quality of construction.

Seakeeping ( skp ): how well the vessel mitigates high seas; factors include freeboard and the number of masts.

ADVENTURE

TRAVEL

## voyage routine

With crew and vessel established, take the following steps to conduct a sea voyage:

| [�] Environment.............................................page ���     |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [�] Weather Rose............................................page ���     |
| [�] Sailing Roll ...............................................page ��� |
| [�] Storm Run................................................page ���    |
| [5] Movement ................................................page ���    |

Scale: one turn through the Voyage Routine equals one day . One 'hex' (or space) of movement covers 25 leagues (100 kilometres). This distance is also the length of one Atlas Square in Kelestia Production's mapping system.

Encounters: GMs may include pre-planned maritime encounters with vessels or beasts, or may check for them randomly by making two special d�� rolls against TN�. Each successful d10 roll signifies one encounter at some point during the day. It might be helpful first to complete steps 1 through 5 before selecting the precise time they occur. Refer to the encounter section and the Maritime Encounter table (pages 406-407) for additional detail.

## [1] Environment

Describe the general environment by Season, Body of water, and Course. These might not change day to day.

Season : identify the season, as discussed in the Trekking Routine (page 142)-spring, summer, autumn, or winter. Body : the Voyage Routine distinguishes three large bodies of water in Venarive-the North, the Venarian Sea, and the Tropics. Identify the journey's body by its shade of blue on the Venârivè Seafaring map on page 152.

Next, decide whether the vessel will select a course along a Coast (within the same hex as land) or in the open Sea (one or more hexes from land). Coastal routes allow vessels to avoid dangerous storms; the open sea leaves them vulnerable.

<!-- image -->

Course : select the direction the vessel sails according to six hexsides (see diagram). This does not strictly represent a straight line but a likely series of back-andforth direction changes in response to the day's winds. The scale of the 25-league spaces simply conceals the exact course. nw sw se ne n s

Endurance ( end ): the number of days of food and water carried given a full outfitting. For reasons of safety, the largest seagoing vessels in this epoch routinely limit voyages to a couple of weeks, so the 30 to 60 day onset of scurvy is usually not an issue. Longships like the Vaserskab and Laru have little space for provisions given their huge rowing crews-they usually beach or seek haven daily.

The results  of the Seafaring ML table assume an individual Pilot ML70. When a	specific	Pilot	skill	is	used	instead	(such as a PC's), adjust the generated ML by plus	or	minus	five	for	each	Pilot	Index above or below 7, respectively.

## [2] Weather Rose

Determine the Weather Rose for the day according to the Body and Season that were established in step 1.

Wind Modifier :	around	the	rose's	perimeter,	identify	the	modifier that	corresponds	to	the	sailing	Course	chosen	in	step	1.	This	applies to	the	d20	Sailing	Roll	in	step	3.

Storm Index : the number in the middle of the rose is the Target Number	(TN)	used	in	a	Storm	Check,	if	one	is	called	for	in	step	3.

## [3] Sailing Roll

Roll d20. A natural 5, 10, 15, or 20 means a Storm Check occurs. If there is no Storm Check, then proceed to step 5 and apply this same d20 Sailing Roll result to Movement.

Storm Check : make two d10 rolls against the Storm Index TN from step 2. If either fail, then no true storm arisesmerely intermittent gusts or ominous clouds that do not impede the vessel. Proceed to Movement (step 5).

If both succeed, a storm arises with a Storm Severity equal to the lower d10 result. If in a Coast hex. the vessel may find Safe Haven by anchoring in sheltered waters; it avoids the storm but does not move for the day (return to step 1). Vessels in a Coast hex that decline Safe Haven, or Vessels in a Sea hex, must make a Storm Run (step 4).

## [4] Storm Run

In a Storm Run, the ship drops sails and 'runs before the storm', letting itself be carried along with the wind and waves. Make a Seafaring Success Value test.

Flooding (FL) : subtract the vessel's SKP and the stars of the Seafaring SV test (0-5) from the Storm Severity. A positive remainder equals the amount of Flooding (FL) accrued. If FL equals at least half HUL, the vessel suffers a -10 penalty to Sailing Rolls. If FL equals HUL, the vessel can no longer move under its own power (but may drift). If FL exceeds HUL, it sinks in d6 hours. Starting the next day, crews can choose to bail one FL per day in exchange for not moving.

Critical Failure : if the Seafaring SV test included a CF, roll two dice of a size equal to Storm Severity. If both results exceed SIZ, then the vessel capsizes from a breaking wave.

Example : facing a Storm Severity 6, a Dak makes a Seafaring SV test against ML74. A roll of 95 generates SV5 (a one-star storm run). Having SKP1, the vessel suffers FL4 (Storm 6 - SKP1 - 1 Star). A -10 penalty now applies to d20 Sailing Rolls (FL4 ≥ half HUL5). The CF also induces two d6 rolls against its SIZ4: a 3 and 6 mean it does not capsize since only the 6 exceeded its SIZ.

## storm drift

Line up the Drift Direction diagram so that the arrow points towards the highest Wind Modifier from the day's Weather Rose in step 2. Randomly select one among several equally highest Wind Modifiers. With the arrow aligned, roll a d10. If Storm Severity exceeds vessel SIZ, the vessel drifts one hex in the direction the result indicates in the diagram. If storm Severity does not exceed vessel SIZ, the vessel may either accept the same drift, or not move at all (from lost and regained headway, for example).

<!-- image -->

Example : a Dak in the waters of the North sails south (S) during autumn when it faces and survives a Storm Severity 6. Because 6 exceeds its SIZ4, the vessel drifts. The Weather Rose in step 2 has +8 for both the NE and SE; a random roll selects the SE. The d10 direction roll is 3-the Dak drifts one hex NE (above right).

Grounding : if storm drift carries a vessel into land, then reduce HUL by d�. A new Seafaring test lessens the d� roll by � (S) or � (CS), down to a minimum �. If HUL is reduced to � or less, then the vessel wrecks on or near the shore.

After adjudicating Storm Drift, return to step �.

## [5] Movement

The vessel moves the number of hexes given in the first column of the Sailing Roll table below that corresponds to the d�� Sailing Roll result (step �) with both the Wind modifier (step �) and Flooding modifier (step �) included.

The path of movement is in the direction chosen in step � but may include 'turns' of up to one hexside to stay reasonably on the intended course.

Current Arrow : a vessel that crosses, or ends on top of or within one hex of, a Current Arrow is shifted one hex in the current's direction if a d10 roll succeeds against TN5.

Return to step � for the next day's seafaring.
