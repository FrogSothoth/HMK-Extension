# Advice & Options

## aberrance

Aberrance	affects	all	creatures	(people	and	beasts)	who	do not	themselves	possess	it.	Thus,	many	spirits,	and	those creatures	with	an	ABE	score,	are	usually	immune	to	its effect.	Consider	the	following	options.

Aberrant Morale :	boost	the	effective	morale	of	entities with	ABE	to	reflect	their	atypical,	even	unnatural	instinct. Aberrant entities ignore a number of morale triggers in a given	encounter	equal	to	the	score	itself.	When	they	must make	a	Morale	Roll,	they	receive	a	bonus	equal	to	ABE ×5.

Attenuated ABE :	reduce	the	effect	of	an	entity's	ABE according	to	how	often	an	individual	has	faced	it.	This option	requires	the	GM	to	track	such	instances-the	ABE score	of	a	type	of	entity	lessens	by	one	per	successful	Fear Roll	the	character	has	made	facing	it	(a	CS	counts	as	two).

Group ABE :	creatures	appearing	in	numbers	affect	others according	to	just	the	base	ABE.	Thus,	one,	three,	or	twelve Vlasta	express	ABE1.

Relative ABE :	due	to	occupational,	environmental,	or cultural	exposure,	certain	characters	are	immune	to	a	given source.	Priests	who	summon	or	face	entities	with	ABE	may ignore	an	amount	equal	to	their	Circle,	such	as	Agrikans facing	V'hir	or	Ilvirans	facing	Ivashu.	The	GM	could	also grant ABE	to	normal	creatures,	such	as	dragons,	to	set	a tone	for	a	specific	campaign	or	gaming	preference.

## creature size table

The Creature Size table to the right shows some of the basic	characteristics	used	in	the	Bestiary	chapter.	The	GM can	model	playable	new	ones	by	consulting	this	table,	the existing	chapter	examples,	and	the	Ivashu	Generation	rules on	page	376.

## oversized target zone option

A	weapon's	Zone	Die	size	might	be	so	small	that	striking certain	zones	on	larger	targets	is	automatic.	For	instance,	a broadsword's	d6	ZD	makes	striking	an	Aklash's	Torso	zone automatic	if	the	attacker	aims	correctly-the	Aklash's	six ZN	in	the	Torso	(7-12)	give	no	chance	for	it	not	happening. This	is	a	designed,	realistic	outcome.

As	an	option,	a	target	zone	could	be	deemed Oversized if it has at least twice the	ZN	as	the	size	of	the	striking weapon's	Zone	Die.	When	an	attacker	successfully	strikes such	an	Oversized	target	zone,	then	a	d6	is	rolled	in	place of the usual d10 when determining the Location struck. Moreover,	strikers	can	'place'	this	d6	among	the	1-10	range of	LN	just	like	ZD	routinely	are	with	ZN.

For	example,	a	d6	ZD	broadsword	aimed	at	a	Hru's	Torso (ZN13-28)	automatically	strikes	it-and	its	16	total	zones make	the	Torso	oversized	for	the	sword's	d6	ZD.	Therefore, not	only	can	the	attacker	automatically	place	a	successful broadsword	strike	in	the	torso	zone,	but	a	d6	LD	is	rolled instead	of	the	usual	d10.	The	d6	results	can	be	placed	to	hit the	Thorax	(1-5)	or	Abdomen	(6);	or	perhaps	aimed	at	the Thorax	(5),	Abdomen	(6-7),	Pelvis	(8-10).

Tiny Size :	the	ZD	of	some	weapons	used	by	tiny	creatures already	have	this	Oversize	Target	Zone	rule	scaled	in,	as noted	by	the	1/d6	entry	in	the Creature Size table,	above. The	ZD	of	a	Vlasta's	bite	is 1/d6 (page	375).	The	'1'	means

category : a general description (with the given abbreviation); helps determine how the relative	sizes	of	opponents	affects	melee	aim	(see	Human-Sized	Opponents,	page	355).

str :	approximate	or	typical	Strength,	in	large	part	directly	proportional	to	literal	size.

lbs :	a	general	upper	bound	for	a	creature's	weight	for	a	given	category.	Flying	or	mythic creatures	and	Ivashu	can	be	exceptionally	light	or	heavy	for	their	size.

zn :	the	number	of	body	Zone	Numbers	a	creature	has,	spread	over	several	body	zones in its Hit Location table,	according	to	physiology.	The	ZN	that	account	for wings usually do	not	affect	the	creature' s	size	category	(thus,	a	Wyre	has	20	ZN	but	is	considered	only a	large	creature).	Zone	Numbers	are	also	used	to	adjudicate	Overruns	(page	353),	and	to resolve	certain	missiles	strike	(see	Zone	Number:	Missile	Strikes,	below).

tar :	the	rating	used	in	the	Massive	Target	and	Target	Count	rules	of	Missile	attacks (pages	163-164).	Little	creatures	have tar 1	because,	if	struck,	their	fewer	ZN	already present	a	chance	for	the	ZD	roll	to	miss	despite	a	successful	strike.

rch :	base	Reach	modifier.	The	nature	of	the	body	location	used	can	adjust	this	further: Bite (dog-like	neck	+1;	long	neck	+2;	serpentine	+3); Claw/punch/grab (folk-like	limb	+1; long limb +2 or +3); Kick (as	for	claw/punch	+1).	A	claw' s	'blade'	can	itself	be	longer	(+1).

bite/claw/tail :	the	Zone	Die	usually	rolled	with	the	respective	natural	weapon	attacks. Special or monstrous predators might have natural weapon ZD one size smaller than their	corresponding	creature	size	would	indicate.	For	instance,	a	young	dragon' s bite uses d3	ZD	even	though	the	bite	of	a	beast	its	size	usually	gets	d4.

space :	the	length	in	5-foot	spaces	of	one	side	the	creature	occupies,	assuming	that long	creatures	are	rearing	up	or	coiled.	Even	though	Large	or	Big,	horses	have	about 5-foot long bodies ,	and	thus	occupy	one	space,	which	makes	adjudicating	a	mount-rider combination	on	a	gaming	grid	as	simple	as	any	unmounted	one-space	warrior.

the	Vlasta	automatically	gets	to	choose	the	ZN	struck	(without	rolling);	the	'd6' refers	to	the	roll	for	determining	the	LN.

## zone number: missile strikes

The	ZN	struck	by	near-miss	direct	missile	strikes,	and	all	volley	missile	strikes, is	determined	randomly	by	rolling	the	larger	of	a	d10	or	a	die	of	the	same	size as	the	target's	number	of	ZN	(page	164).	For	instance,	a	d10	is	rolled	when	a Vlasta	(3	ZN)	or	human	is	struck	(10	ZN);	a	d20	is	rolled	for	horses	(20	ZN).

For creatures with 16	Zone	Numbers (such	as	an	Aklash),	instead	of	a	literal d16,	the	result	of	a	d8	roll	can	be	multiplied	by	two	and	applied	to	the	same	ZN column,	reflecting	very	similar	probabilities.	For	creatures	like	the	Hru	with 40 Zone	Numbers ,	a	d10	roll	multiplied	by	four	works	equally	well.	Although	the chapter	has	no	creatures	with	30	ZN,	a	d10	multiplied	by	three	works	similarly.

When	such	missiles	strike dragons ,	simply	roll	a	d100	on	the	Old	Dragon's ZN column;	the	location	results	are	the	same	no	matter	the	dragon's	size.

## zone reach penalty

The	Zone	Reach	Penalty	explained	in	the	page	352	box	is	scaled	to	medium-size folk	attacking	larger, upright creatures,	who	are	either	naturally	bipedal	(Hru) or	rearing	up	(dragon).	Ignore	this	'vertical'	reach	penalty	if	these	taller	targets are	prone	or	positioned	horizontally.	The	GM	can	modify	this	penalty	in	special circumstances-being	mounted	would	reduce	it	by	one,	for	instance.

If	any	striker	has	a negative Reach after	accounting	for	the	Zone	Reach Penalty,	then	such	a	strike	cannot	be	attempted-the	zone	is	out	of	reach.
