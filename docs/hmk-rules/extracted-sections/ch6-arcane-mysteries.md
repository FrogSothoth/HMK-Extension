# Arcane Mysteries

## arcane mysteries

Whether through innate ability or studied technique, an arcanist attempts to harness the forces of Kelestia while inhabiting the physical world. The process is categorised according to three general methods-incantation, alchemy, and divination.

Incantation (page 195): incanters directly channel ethereal energy into their body and then try to express it in the world in a particular, controlled way. Due to such powerful absorption of these forces, many scholars consider incantation a primary method of magic.

Alchemy (page 265): alchemists manipulate at a conceptual distance the ethereal energies found in herbs and minerals and then incorporate them into a magical concoction. Its slightly less direct interaction with the forces makes some rank alchemy as a secondary method.

Divination (page 275): diviners view from an even greater abstract distance the energies seen throughout Kelestia, in order to interpret them as expressions of Fate. Divination's remove from direct interaction with the forces-while still firmly magical-is sometimes described as a tertiary arcane method.

Other arcane mysteries exist on Kethira, but they are more obscure, especially in Venarive. Priests of certain proscribed religions, in fact, employ arcane gateways in their practice of Ritual Summoning (page 346).

## esoterica

Skilled practitioners of both the arcane and astral mysteries are able to manipulate the ethereal entities and energies found in reality according to their will. This ability to control the precise outcome of their endeavours links them both as esoterica . Participants in the divine mysteries, however, may only invite intervention and have no way of dictating the form the 'miraculous' will take-a lack of dominion is the crucial difference from esoterica. Divine rituals still manifest an effect, but it is often inseparable from the apparent benefits of inspiration or mundane luck.

## aural shock

Esoterica Group skills all have Aura as the primary attribute of their skill base and, therefore, all share a vulnerability to Aural Shock. When suffering this mental trauma, esotericists are temporarily unable to manifest their arcane and astral abilities.

## true form

A few spells and arcane talents require the esotericist to view the target's True Form, another name for the soul. In the spirit world, astrals can directly perceive the subject's True Form; from the physical world, arcanists can use certain talents and spells to detect it in the subject's Aura (page 209 sidebar).
