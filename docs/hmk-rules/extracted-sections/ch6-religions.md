# Religions

## Religions

The belief in a culture's pantheon does not express itself directly as a game mechanic. Players simply roleplay their character's fidelity to its various gods to whatever extent they wish, perhaps taking into account morality and personality traits. Characters test Folklore to measure general knowledge of their native pantheon, such as a salient overview of its various religions.

## ritual skill

A Ritual skill exists for each religion. Even those that share the same aspect have their own skill: Ilvir and Ylvyr both express IVO aspect but have different Ritual ML. Two religions employ regional spellings but share a Ritual ML with the more common name: Eoni/Peoni; Varani/Larani.

## church hierarchy

Characters with Ritual skill in a religion are called its followers . Most religions have two types of followersclergy (the ordained leaders of the church); and laity (everyone else). Some religions sponsor fighting orders that accept lay followers as members.

All religions recognise their followers' access to ritual performance according to Circles of Command. These range from no circle (the basic precepts known by the laity) up to Circle VII (the most obscure clerical practices). Most religions also express church offices at certain circles. For example, here is the Laranian hierarchy:

| laránichurchhierarchy   | laránichurchhierarchy   | laránichurchhierarchy            |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| circle                  | clergy offices          | fighting orderoffices            |
| I                       | Acolyte                 | Soldier • Knight • Knight-errant |
| II                      | -                       | Commander                        |
| III                     | Temple Priest           | Grandmaster                      |
| IV                      | High Priest • Bishop    | -                                |
| V                       | Archbishop              | -                                |
| VI                      | Primate                 | -                                |
| VII                     | Pontiff                 | -                                |

Some religions have no offices, and even a very loose definition of 'clergy'. Whatever the church, the maximum Circle of Command depends on the type of follower.

Clergy : characters of the Priest, tribal Invoker, and Shaman occupations (and Ritual ML20+) are of Circle I to Circle VII. These are gained in order, even if a circle has no office or even in religions without church offices at all.

Fighting Order : the highest available circle is the highest one with an office. Thus, the highest circle in a Laranian fighting order is III (with Grandmaster its one office).

Laity : all other followers are laity and have zero Circles of Command, no matter how high their Ritual ML.

## Circle Advancement

|                                                                                            | circle   |   sv |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------|
| Followers may try to obtain the first or next Circle at a festival, a sacred event usually | I        |    2 |
| held only once or twice a year. The follower                                               | II       |    4 |
| makes a Ritual (Intrigue SR) Success Value                                                 | III      |    6 |
| test (Intrigue success increases SV by 1).                                                 | IV       |    8 |
|                                                                                            | V        |   10 |
| The follower advances if the result at least                                               | VI       |   11 |
| equals the SV required according to the Circle sought (see table right).                   | VII      |   12 |

Morality : reduce SV by 1 for each point the follower's MOR score diverges from the closest end of the faith's accepted range (see Orthodox Morality, page 322).

Office : if the Circle has an office, the same Ritual (Intrigue SR) test also resolves whether the office can be obtained:

| circle   | testresultinordertoobtainoffice                      |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| I        | Either the Ritual test or the Intrigue SRsucceed.    |
| II-III   | Both the Ritual test and the Intrigue SRsucceed.     |
| IV-VII   | The Ritual test is a CS and the Intrigue SRsucceeds. |

Example : a lay follower with Larani Ritual ML22 and Intrigue ML30 tries to obtain Circle I (Acolyte). The Ritual (Intrigue SR) SV test roll is 42 (failure) with a d10 roll 1 (success), resulting in SV2 (Ritual Index 2 - 1 + 1 = 2). The SV2 is high enough to obtain Circle I and the Office requirement is also met, since the Intrigue SR succeeded despite the Ritual test failing.

If the office is not obtained, the Circle is usually denied. In rare cases of nepotism or sudden vacancy, offices might be awarded regardless of Circle or Ritual ML.

Fighting Order Advancement : the Ritual (Intrigue SR) Success Value test to advance must also include the character's Initiative Secondary Modifier.

## religious practices

Whatever the circle or office, characters can take part in a religion through four practices. All religions employ the same four routines for resolving each of these practices.

Ceremony (page 316): the most routine expression of faith, often led by clergy and attended by many followers.

Festival (page 317): usually annual celebrations where followers gather at a special place or time to renew their essential beliefs.

Ordeal (page 318): hallowed actions undertaken by the faithful, or even sometimes by those outside the religion.

Ritual Devotion (page 318): acts of prayer by clergy, who may target their effects at themselves or at followers or other voluntary worthies.

## style secondary roll

The following list of service Styles is not exhaustive; some ceremonies might use others.

| style     | sr   | examples                 |
|-----------|------|--------------------------|
| Dance     | agl  | Agrikan combat manoeuvre |
| Ecstasy   | emp  | Sarajinian revelry       |
| Oration   | elo  | Laranian sermons         |
| Spectacle | cre  | Ilviran theatrics        |

The presiding priest may derive the SR from an alternate skill if it produces a higher TN. Dance can replace AGL in the Dance style; Discourse, in an Oration; and Theatrics, in a Spectacle.

Oration : followers and the presiding priest must have at least Index  2 and 3, respectively, in the local language used (or in the temple tongue used if the church has one). Otherwise, they all may only enter Solitary Prayer.

## solitary prayer

Many ceremonies allow or require followers to worship alone rather than attend a service. Such solitary prayer must take place at the same date and time as a service. All the effects and modifiers of a service apply to solitary prayer except where noted here:

- The Blessing bonus equals the SV-result of the follower's own Ritual Success Value test.
- There is no Benediction Modifier.
- Maximum bestowal equals Ritual Index + 1.
- Doctrine subjects are selected among those of a level equal to or below ceremony level.

## ceremony example

A Circle III Larani priest named Xelden has Larani Ritual ML71, Piety 2|4, and MOR14. He performs the Soratir oration speaking Hârnic, but not on sacred ground. The d100 test roll is 84 (F), producing Success Value  6 (Ritual Index 7 - 1 = SV6) and a two-star benediction. Xelden has ELO12 (ML60), so two d10 SR are made against TN6. A 4 and 8 equal one success: a +1 benediction modifier.

A follower named Jela with Larani Ritual ML15, Hârnic ML48, Piety 1, and MOR16 attends this very same Soratir ceremony. Jela receives a +2 blessing: +1 from her Larani Ritual Index  1 and +1 from the Xelden's benediction modifier. Her Piety remains 1. She applies the +2 blessing bonus to tests of one doctrinal subject, choosing Initiative (page 316).

The attending priest Xelden gets +1 bonus from his own benediction and +7 from his Larani Ritual Index  7. This equals the maximum +8 blessing bonus for the next 30 days. His Piety 2|4 is restored to its maximum 4 (Circle III plus 1 from a Festival bonus), and he applies the +8 blessing bonus to the tests of four doctrinal subjects for 30 days-Initiative, Riding, Melee, and Shock.

## Ceremony

The most common religious practice is the ceremony; followers participate in them to receive a blessing. The ceremonies of the West Venarian pantheon are detailed on the second page of each religion's description (pages 326-44). Resolve these nine steps to complete one:

[�] Date : ceremonies take place only on specific days of the month, varying according to religious tradition.

[�] Requirements : some ceremonies require a minimum circle and office, most often the high ceremonies. Low ceremonies have no such requirements and are usually open to all, although some followers might be denied attendance by the clergy or church for political reasons.

[�] Style : clergy of at least Circle III must perform the ceremony. The service is done in a specific Style, each keyed to a Secondary Roll in step 5, below (see sidebar Style Secondary Roll for sample types).

[�] Time : ceremony length varies, as stated specifically in each entry. Followers must attend the entire period in order to receive the blessing.

[�] Benediction : at the end of the ceremony, the presiding priest makes a Ritual Success Value test. This is called the Benediction Roll.

Trauma : the priest must be able to maintain concentration (page 182) throughout the ceremony. All types of fatigue apply to the test.

Sacred Ground : apply the Consecration bonus if the ceremony takes place on sacred ground (see the Consecration Ordeal, page 320).

## sv ritual success value test

Critical Failure : priest tests Will -any	failure	reduces	benediction	modifier	by	one.

[�] Blessing : a completed ceremony bestows a blessing bonus on both the attendees and presiding priest. The bonus equals each follower's own Ritual Index plus the benediction modifier from step 5:

## blessing bonus  =  follower's ritual index  +  benediction modifier

Maximum Blessing : the maximum bestowal equals the presiding priest's Ritual Index + 1, regardless of a follower's own Ritual Index.

[�] Piety Restoration : the ceremony also restores a follower's Piety to its maximum, no matter its current amount. Maximum Piety equals the higher of either Circle or 1; plus 1 for a Festival bonus (page 317).

Morality : reduce maximum Piety by 1 for each point a follower's MOR diverges from the faith's Orthodox Morality score (page 322).

[�] Doctrine : followers apply the blessing bonus to the EML of tests in a number of Doctrinal subjects equal to their maximum Piety . Attendees are limited to the subjects according to ceremony level (low or high); a presiding priest has access to both low and high subjects (page 322).

[�] Duration : 30 days. Attending identical ceremonies within the same 30-day span has no effect. Some religions simply offer more opportunities for followers to attend the same ceremony each month.

year, ronowers samply have the Chance lo gan the nerewea rail beneat more often; however, the bonus never exceeds one.

## Festival

Followers may participate in special events called festivals. Uniquely named for each religion, they allow the faithful to renew the religion's core principles. Resolve the following eight steps to complete a festival.

[�] Date : festivals take place on specific days, varying according to religion, but most often only once a year. See pages 324-342 for the specific festivals each religion celebrates. The festival's date might also correspond to a monthly ceremony-complete the festival routine before the ceremony routine.

[�] Requirements : most festivals have no Circle requirement, so all attending followers may benefit.

[�] Style : festivals usually require the lead of at least Circle IV clergy and can vary in Style, as for a Ceremony (page 316, step 3). Some festivals can consist of Solitary Prayer (page 316 sidebar).

[�] Time : festivals last several days or weeks, but there might be shorter exceptions. Followers must attend throughout to receive their benefits.

[�] Circle Advancement : followers may seek Circle Advancement (page 315). Sometimes such advancement attempts occur at other times of the year, such as when a suddenly vacated office needs filling.

[�] Benediction : at the festival's end, the attending priest makes a Benediction Roll identical to that made in a Ceremony (page 316, step 5), including the same modifiers to the Ritual test. Apply the SV result to the same table and generate a number of Style Secondary Rolls.

[�] Renewed Faith : for each individual clerical and lay attendee roll the number of Style SR dice as generated by the priest's Benediction Roll in step 6. If at least one Style SR succeeds, then that follower receives a +1 Festival bonus to their monthly maximum Piety .

Morality : for each point the attending priest's or follower's own MOR diverges from the faith's nearest Orthodox Morality score (page 322), reduce the number of Style SR dice by one. If the number of dice is reduced to zero or less, then that follower receives no rolls.

Solitary Prayer : for festivals celebrated through Solitary Prayer, each follower completes their own Benediction in step 6 and generates their own Secondary Style SR using Will . The Morality modifier still applies.

[�] Duration : one year. For religions that hold multiple Festivals each year, followers simply have the chance to gain the Renewed Faith benefit more often; however, the bonus never exceeds one.

## festival example

Jéla has Morality 16 and Piety 1. She takes part in the Feast of Saint Ambrathas , the yearly Laranian festival (page 330). The presiding Circle IV High Priest has Ritual ML82, ELO16, and MOR14. The Benediction Roll is 42, resulting in SV8 (four stars). Four d10 are rolled for Jela against the priest's Style TN8 (the Index of ELO16). A 2, 3, 6, and 10 produce at least one success, so Jela receives the +1 bonus to her maximum Piety from the Renewed Faith of the festival. With zero Circles of Command, Jela now has a maximum Piety 2 for the ensuing year (see step 7 of the Ceremony routine, page 316).

## divine archetypes

For characters primarily involved in the divine mysteries, specific characteristics and skills can shade their personality. Consider these disparate religious archetypes:

The Crony has been appointed to a church office without the usual Circle of Command or even Ritual ML. Such nepotism is usually rare.

The Cynical might not have Grace but does have Ritual skill, high ELO, and a church office. The Cynical could be the self-serving Peonian bishop with a corruptible morality; or a true deviant with even darker motives.

The Hermit has attained Circle III and a high Ritual ML but expresses faith purely through Solitary Prayer and Ritual Devotion.

The Immaculate has Grace and perhaps some Ritual ML. This could be a devout child-saint or a nuanced character like Jayda (page 312).

The Lucky has Grace but no Ritual ML. The good fortune comes about unconsciously, as in the example of Sarbo (page 312).

The Pretender has no Grace and some Ritual ML but does have Theatrics skill, high WIL, and perhaps lore skills. This could be the charlatan priest who bilks the parish out of its tithes.

The Scholar has Ritual ML in several religions, even those of widely different Morality. The character pursues religious knowledge, whether an effective (orthodox) follower or not.

The Subversive has high Ritual ML and has attained several Circles in the clergy. However, with an unorthodox Morality score, the Subversive is there to spy or undermine, likely drawing on strong Guile and Intrigue skills.

The Tortured Soul has Grace, but from a diametric Aspect, such as a guilt-wracked knight of Larani whose Grace is associated with chaos and annihilation ( mor ).

The Virtuous has both Grace and Ritual mastery. This is the religious paragon-a questing paladin of Larani, a diabolical reaver of Agrik, a prophet of Save-K'nor.

## types of ordeals

Religious ordeals can take many forms. For descriptive purposes they are usually considered one of four types.

Pilgrimage : a journey to sacred ground or to a relic. Each religion defines specifically what constitutes the destination and sometimes even the route of such trips.

Quest : the completion of a specific action in the name of a religion's tenets. While often including great travel, the successful quest depends on the accomplishment of a specific goal, regardless of where it takes the follower.

Sacrifice : the offering of something in the name of the follower's deity. Such an oblation might not require travel or even much effort; the emphasis is rather on the presentation of the object/person-the sacrificed.

Trial : the risk of divine judgement. The follower undergoes appraisal or performs an action, both to demonstrate religious purity.

## ordeal magnitude

An ordeal is rated according to its magnitudeminor, substantial, or great. The number in parentheses is how many d20 Ordeal Rolls are granted in step 4 of the Ordeal routine.

Minor (1) : most often simple trials and sacrifices, neither of which endanger the follower very much. The most routine pilgrimages might be minor ordeals, but quests, by definition, rarely are.

Substantial (2) : most trials and sacrifices, and many arduous pilgrimages. The simplest quests are usually substantial ordeals.

Great (3) : only the most important trials and sacrifices are great ordeals, whereas many pilgrimages and most quests demand this highest level of effort.

## ordeal rolls

|       |   starting totalgrace | starting totalgrace   | starting totalgrace   | starting totalgrace   |
|-------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| d20   |                     0 | 1-2                   | 3-5                   | 6+                    |
| 1-4   |                     0 | 0                     | 0                     | 0                     |
| 5-6   |                     0 | 0                     | 0                     | 1                     |
| 7-8   |                     0 | 0                     | 1                     | 1                     |
| 9-10  |                     0 | 1                     | 1                     | 1                     |
| 11-20 |                     1 | 1                     | 1                     | 1                     |

Ordeal Example : a devotee with Grace 0|1 completes a great quest and so rolls three separate d20 on the above table-the results are 3, 11, and 17. Each is separately compared to the 1-2 column since the devotee had 1 total grace at the start of the ordeal. The dice rolls generate 2 Grace from the quest (0 + 1 + 1), increasing the character's Grace to 2|3.

## Ordeal

An ordeal is the rarest religious practice, undertaken by the devout in hopes of entering a state of grace with their deity. It is seemingly the most dramatic way a follower ever 'connects' with their god.

See the sidebar for a description of several types of ordeals and their level of importance, called magnitude. When a character undertakes an ordeal, take the following five steps to determine its effect.

[�] Kind : note the kind of ordeal borne, rated according to magnitude (minor, substantial, or great) and type (pilgrimage, quest, sacrifice, or trial). For the West Venarian pantheon, the details of many unique ordeals are given in the religion entries that follow (pages 324-342).

[�] Devotee : the character embracing the ordeal is called the devotee. Certain ordeals have restrictions concerning who may undertake them. Most require the devotee to be a follower of a specific religion, or even a special sub-class, such as 'knight of Larani'.

Sometimes non-followers may undertake an ordeal. Certain rare ordeals might be open to those without even their conscious volition. For instance, a cruel and unforgiving warrior overcome with battlelust during a large conflict might afterwards draw the attention of the AGR aspect, which views the bloodthirsty display as a successful minor trial.

[�] Feat : each ordeal describes very specifically the actions required of the devotee. This is called the feat. Failing to complete the feat results in a failed ordeal. Fulfilling it allows the devotee to proceed to step 4.

[�] Ordeal Rolls : upon completion of the feat, the devotee is allowed to make one, two, or three separate d20 rolls on the Ordeal Rolls table in the sidebar. The exact number of rolls is determined by the ordeal's magnitude. Each such roll generates zero (0) or one (1) Grace, according to the devotee's total Grace possessed at the start of the ordeal.

Marked for Grace : when characters with a Grace of '0 marked' complete an Ordeal, they roll an extra d20 for the Ordeal Roll, dropping the lowest result and applying the rest. If they earn at least 1 Grace, the marked status is removed. If they fail to earn Grace, the marked status remains.

[�] Grace : the summed result of all d20 Ordeal rolls equals the number of grace the devotee receives for completing the ordeal. This increases both the character's total grace and the amount left for miracles.

## Ritual Devotion

Starting at Circle II , clergy are taught Ritual Devotion to express their faith beyond the liturgical formality of ceremonies. Such prayer enables them to extend extemporaneously the blessings of church doctrine to themselves, followers, and even those outside the faith.

Clergy of at least Circle II with at least one Piety may undertake a Ritual Devotion by resolving the following six steps.

[�] Doctrine : the cleric selects one Doctrinal subject from among those in the cleric's own blessings, as determined in a recent ceremony.

[�] Target : the cleric designates the target of the Ritual Devotion-either Self or one Other folk (that is, a being with Morality and Purpose). If Other is selected, the cleric must be able to touch the target with a Sacred Object throughout Time in step 3. Communication between the cleric and target is also required, satisfied by a shared Language of at least Index 2, or by arcane means (such as Telepathy).

Willing Recipient : the target must consciously agree to accept the cleric's Ritual Devotion or the routine ends. Agreement could be voluntary or the result of Persuasion tests or esoterica such as Suggestion or Enthral. Targets do not have to vocalise their resistance, but a successful Empathy or Intrigue test by the cleric might reveal such tacit refusal.

[�] Time : the cleric spends a one-round action in concentrated prayer. Although this might include 'cant' or 'gesture' according to religious tradition, neither affect the outcome. If concentration (page 182) is broken during the round for either the cleric or recipient, the prayer is ruined and the cleric must start over to complete it.

[�] Test : immediately following the one-round prayer, the cleric tests Ritual as a 1-turn action. All fatigue penalties apply, but usually no impairment, outside of trauma that prevents concentration.

## ritual devotion roll

- cf No	effect,	but	the	cleric	must	spend	1	Piety.
- f No	effect,	and	neither	the	cleric	nor	the	target	has	to	spend	Piety.
- s A willing recipient receives a blessing bonus to tests of the designated subject equal to half the	cleric's	own	blessing	bonus.	Reduce	the	bonus	by	1	if	the target	is	not	a	follower	of	the	cleric's	religion;	and	by	1	per	point	of	Unorthodox Morality	the	target	has	compared	to	the	religion's	nearest	range.	Either	the cleric,	or	a	target	who	is	a	follower,	must	spend	1	Piety	(cleric's	choice).
- cs As	above	for	Success	(S),	but	neither	cleric	nor	target	must	spend	Piety.

[�] Duration : 30 days. Only one Ritual Devotion Roll in the designated subject is allowed by the same cleric per target per 24 hours, regardless of the resulting success level. Someone targeted with multiple Ritual Devotions in the same subject receives only the single-highest effect.

The blessing bonus from Ritual Devotion does combine with the blessing bonus the target receives at a Ceremony in the same subject during the periods when both of their Durations overlap.

Ritual Devotion Example 1 : Jela worships Larani and received a +2 blessing bonus to Initiative tests from a Soratir ceremony two days ago (page 316 sidebar). The Circle III Laranian priest Xelden targets Jela for Ritual Devotion in Initiative on the eve of a battle. He anoints her with a tap of a consecrated mace; she accepts his prayer; and his Larani Ritual ML71 test is a Success (S). The cleric chooses to have Jela spend 1 Piety and she receives a +4 devotion bonus for 30 days, for a total +6 bonus to Initiative tests for the next 28 days.

Ritual Devotion Example 2 : the Kuboran Myrak is a gladiator in the arenas of Rethem. He takes part in the Agrik low ceremonies of his masters, and has a follower's Agrik Ritual ML15. With a Morality 15 outside the religion's upper orthodoxy of 14, Myrak has maximum Piety 1 for the current month (1 - 1 MOR penalty + 1 festival bonus) and receives a +2 blessing bonus (Shock). On the eve of a spectacle, Myrak accepts a ritual devotion from a priest of Agrik who has +8 blessing bonus in Shock. A success (S) grants him +3 bonus (4 - 1 MOR penalty) for a total +5 bonus to Shock tests. Either Myrak or priest pays the Piety 1 cost.

## special ritual devotions

Most religions also instruct their clergy in special Ritual Devotions, such as Consecration and Exorcism (page 320), and Summoning (page 346). Some are unique to a particular faith, as with Hailing Ivashu (page 372). These all include Piety expenditure, but they can have higher Circle requirements and involve unique routines and effects.

## divine mysteries summary

Eight game terms govern how characters interact with the Divine Mysteries.

Aspect (page 309) is a concept scholars use to describe the gods worshipped throughout Kethira in terms of twelve transcendent powers. So, while followers have developed specific religions around what they view as unique deities, these scholars consider them manifestations of these twelve Aspects.

The game rules might refer to the 'gods' or 'Lesser Gods' when, according to this concept, they actually mean this constellation of powers. For instance, whereas players assign Grace to an Aspect , their characters might, in-world, view the connection as being with a god .

Grace (page 311) is a state the gods grant to mortals that allows them to request miracles. One point of grace corresponds to one miracle. The gods grant Grace to characters both at birth and in response to their deeds in life. It is a rating consisting of a remaining amount (unspent) and a total amount (ever granted).

Ritual (page 315) is a set of Lore Group skills, with each religion represented by its own ML. It measures knowledge of the faith's tenets.

Circle of Command (page 315) measures access to a religion's ritual performance. It is rated from the zero Circle of laity (who do not perform rituals) to Circles I through VII (the ceremonies and prayers taught to the clergy). A character with very high Ritual ML but zero Circle would have no ability to perform the very rituals of which they have great knowledge.

Piety (page 316) measures the reverence a follower has for a religion's tenets. Piety equals the higher of either Circle or 1, plus 1 from a Festival bonus, minus 1 per Unorthodox Morality. Players might roleplay a lay member as 'pious', but Piety is a game mechanic most often employed by clergy characters. It is a rating consisting of a remaining amount and a maximum amount (if any have been spent).

Morality (page 39) is a characteristic on the 1-20+ scale that measures selflessness. Each religion has an Orthodox Morality range that is most suitable for participants (page 322). A follower's Piety is reduced by 1 for each point of unorthodox Morality (minimum 0 Piety).

Practices (page 315) are the four ways to participate in a religion-through Ceremony, Festival, Ordeal, or Ritual Devotion. The latter two can sometimes involve even non-followers.

Blessing (page 316) is an EML bonus applied to a test or a roll, each one of which is called a doctrinal subject. Blessing bonuses measure in large part how mundane inspiration affects a faithful recipient's performance.

## ritual devotion: consecration

Divine	consecration	makes	a	place	or	object sacred.	All	clergy	of	the	West	Venarian pantheon are taught how to perform this Ritual Devotion upon attaining Circle III .

[4] test :	at	the	end	of	the	ritual's	Time,	the priest	takes	a	1-turn	action	to	test Ritual Success Value .	Each	point	of	Unorthodox Morality	the	priest	has	reduces	SV	by	one.

[1] target : the priest selects the place or object to	consecrate.	The	Sacred	Ground	and Sacred Object sections of the religion entries describe	each	faith's	appropriate	targets.

[2] time : the priest performs either a short ritual (3-round action) or a long ritual (4hour	action),	maintaining	concentration. The	GM	may	allow	short	rituals	in	places	or on	objects	not	normally	consectrated	if	the context	seems	applicable,	but	long	rituals may	only	ever	be	performed	on	appropiate targets.	Thus,	an	embattled	Laranian	might be allowed a short ritual to consecrate a	surrounding	field,	but	long	rituals	are allowed	only	in	a	keep	or	fortress.

[3] piety : the priest spends a number of Piety	based	upon	the	target.

Place :	one	Piety	per	10' × 10' × 10'	space.	The area must be contiguous and within LOS of the	priest,	who	must	be	located	inside	it.

Object :	one	Piety.	The	object	must	be	large enough	to	be	easily	seen	but	not	so	heavy	as to	be	so	unportable	(less	than	10	lbs).

[5] effect : the consecration fails if the result	is	SV 4	or	less-there	is	no	effect	even though	Piety	is	still	spent.	For	each	SV	above 4,	one	star	rating	is	produced,	the	effect	of which varies according to whether the target is a consecrated Location or Object:

Location : the area becomes Sacred Ground with a Consecration bonus equal to star rating	× 5. Spirits of	Unorthodox	Morality who	are	within	the	area,	or	who	try	to	enter it,	suffer	a	Fear	Roll	(page	187)	with	a	penalty equal	to	the	Consecration	stars	×5.

Object : the target becomes a Sacred	Object. As	a	1-turn	action,	any	follower	holding it	may	expend	1	Piety	and	make	a	Ritual (Command)	test.	With	success, spirits of Unorthodox	Morality	within	ten	feet	of	the object	suffer	a	Fear	Roll	(page	187)	with	a penalty	equal	to	the	Consecration	stars	×5 (Ritual	CS	-20	penalty).

Spirits	are	affected	whether	incorporeal or	corporeal.	Thus,	incarnated	Gulmora and	V'hir	demons	could	be	vulnerable

## ritual devotion: exorcism

Divine exorcism helps victims recover from possession	and	the	Shadow.	In	the	West Venarian	pantheon,	seven	religions	teach this	Ritual	Devotion	when	their	clergy	attain a	given	Circle	of	Command	(below	left):

(depending	on	Morality),	but	Amorvrin (beings)	and	Dalmorvrin	(objects)	are	not.

[6] duration : a short consecration lasts 10 minutes; a long consecration lasts one month.

Only	the	highest	consecration	star	rating takes	effect	among	several	overlapping sources.	Priests	may	attempt	multiple consecrations	on	the	same	target,	but only	the	highest	star	rating	applies. Such	attempts	suffer	-1	SV	for	each	step difference	in highest Orthodox	Morality descriptor between	the	priest's	and	target's religion.	For	example,	priests	of	Larani ( Exemplary )	suffer	-2	SV	to	consecration results	against	Agrikan	sacred	objects	or places ( Dutiful ).	The	same	penalty	applies to the Ritual (Command) test success level when using Sacred Objects from within a different	religion's	Sacred	Ground.

<!-- image -->

[3] test :	the	exorcist	makes	a Ritual Success Value test.	Assistants	may	add	their	Ritual Index	as	an	EML	bonus.	Locate	the	SV	result on the Exorcism table	(above	right-hand).

## exorcism

| religion   | circle   | ritual sv test     |
|------------|----------|--------------------|
| Haléa      | IV       | ≤ 2 noeffect       |
| Ilvîr      | IV       | 3-4 recovery (emp) |
| Laráni     | III      | 5 1 recovery       |
| Peóni      | II       | 6 2 recovery       |
| Sárajìn    | IV       | 7 3 recovery       |
| Sávè-K'nôr | III      | 8 4 recovery       |
| Siém       | II       | 9+ 5 recovery      |

Clergy	may	attempt	exorcism	on	one	targetvictim	by	taking	the	following	six	steps.

[1] time : the exorcist spends eight hours performing	the	ritual.	This	may	include	up to	two	assistants,	even	laity,	who	have	at least	half	the	Ritual	ML	of	the	exorcist.	All must	remain	within	10	feet	of	the	victim.

[2] piety :	the	exorcist	must	expend	1	Piety, with	the	option	to	spend	more	after	the	test result	(below).

If	the	success	level	of	the	Ritual	SV	test	is not	a	Critical	Failure,	both	the	exorcist	and a target-victim who is a follower of the same religion	may	increase	the	SV	by	1	for	each additional	Piety	spent,	up	to	an	SV	equal	to the	cleric's	Ritual	Index + 1.

[4] effect :	five	times	the	star	result	equals the bonus the victim receives to the Will tests	of	Possession	Recovery	(page	190)	and Shadow	Recovery	(page	378).	SV 3-4	requires the attending exorcist to test Empathy : a success grants the victim +5 (S) or +10 (CS) bonus	to	the	Recovery	tests.

[5] exposure :	in	addition	to	the	recovery effect,	a	Ritual	CF	means	the	exorcist	faces	a threat	from	the	entity	exorcised.	This	occurs no	matter	how	many	Piety	were	spent.

Possession Threat : the exorcist must succeed on a Spirit test or be exposed to possible Spirit	Conflict	from	the	entity	possessing	the victim,	decided	upon	by	the	GM	according	to the	situation.

The Shadow Threat :	the	exorcist	must	make one Shadow Resistance roll versus SHA0 (page	377).	If	the	character	accrues	Shadow Levels,	then	the	exorcism	ends	and	the victim	loses	the	Recovery	bonus.

[6] duration : the bonus applies to all the victim's	recovery	rolls.	The	exorcist	and assistants must attend the victim eight hours	each	day	throughout	the	recovery process	for	the	victim	to	receive	the	bonus, even though the priest does not repeat the Ritual	SV	test.	If	a	different	priest	attempts exorcism,	only	the	highest	bonus	applies.

Example : a Circle II mendicant cleric of Peoni with Ritual ML52 and Piety 3 attempts exorcism on a farmer (with no Piety) possessed by a lesser Gytevsha of Krasula. A devout member of the family	offers	assistance	but	cannot	contribute, having only Peoni Ritual ML24-less than half the mendicant's ML52.

The priest spends eight hours performing the ritual	and	rolls	42-an	SV 5.	The	priest	spends three	Piety,	giving	+15	bonus	to	all	the	farmer's Will tests during Possession Recovery. The priest makes no further Ritual tests but must remain by the farmer's side for eight hours each day throughout recovery for the bonus to apply.

## West Venârian Pantheon KÁLDÔR

The pantheon grew out of the isolated temple-state and tribal religions in the ancient world. A little over a thousand years ago, three of its religions-those of Agrik, Naveh, and Save-K'nor-inaugurated an expansive missionary era that precipitated the rise of the pantheon. Its present alignment has existed for over four hundred years. (N of

## religion entries

Each religion is presented in a two-page format. The introduction in the main body of the first page outlines the core myth surrounding the deity. This is followed by a brief history of the religion's church , a summary of the faithful's core belief , and what usually constitutes the religion's sacred ground and objects . The first page closes with a description of the principal offices and roles of the clergy .

The second page of each entry describes the religious practices-the faith's specific ceremonies , festivals , ordeals , and ritual devotions in which followers might take part. The Religious Practices Format on page 322 explains the layout and terms associated with these events.

<!-- image -->

## church hierarchy

The first page sidebar of each religion entry displays the important data concerning its church hierarchy . The Church Hierarchy Format at the top of page 322 explains the layout and terms associated with this information. Some sidebars might include these other concepts:

## temple tongue

Certain religions teach secret languages to their clergy for use in the ceremonial liturgy. In the West Venarian Pantheon, this includes the churches of Agrik, Ilvir, and Morgath.

## divine servants

Nearly all deities are served by powerful entities in addition to their mortal adherents. Several are detailed in the Bestiary chapter, such as Agrik's V'hir demons (page 399) who are capable of incarnating in the physical world.

## the uncanny

When characters are granted a miracle by their associated Aspect ('god'), the result usually manifests mundanely, indistinguishable from natural processes or extraordinary luck. From time to time, deities-for reasons known only to them-express a miracle that seems to flout the restrictions implied in certain Principles of the Concordat. Although the chance of such an uncanny miracle occurring is resolved by a d20 roll at the moment of the request, the GM ultimately decides whether one actually happens and, if so, what form it takes.

The first page sidebar of each religion's entry includes a section that describes the most appropriate guise uncanny miracles express according to the themes and doctrine of the deity. Creatures who clearly witness an uncanny miracle might have to make a Fear Roll, depending on how unexpected it is. Consult the Manifestation table (page 396) for guidance-it might appear like ghostly phenomena. GMs can also determine just how uncanny they wish miracles to be-some may prefer even more magical-like expressions.

## pontificates

The map to the left indicates the pontifical seats of three religions of the West Venarian pantheon: Berema ( Save-K'nor ), Perna ( Peoni ), and Tengela ( Larani ).

Four religions have their pontificates in cities located in various realms further east around the Venarian Sea. Both Lysara ( Agrik ) and Meokolis ( Morgath ) are located in Azeryan; Helas ( Halea ) is in Karejia; and Manquideh ( Naveh ), in Dalkesh.

The three remaining religions have no official pontificates ( Ilvir , Sarajin , Siem ).

## ágrik

Lord of the Four Horsemen · Master of the V'hîr · Immortal Warlord of Bàlgasháng · Breeder of Plague, Squalor, and Decay · The Reasonless Reaper · Tyrant of the Foul Chamber · Knower of the Ten Thousand Ways

Agrik is the god of war and violence for its own sake. Cruel and destructive, the fiery Warlord of Balgashang is portrayed as a massive humanoid with leathery wings, cloven hooves, and razor-sharp claws, two of which were severed in an ancient battle with Larani. He wields the flaming mace Gashang , the sickle Syncanus , and Armahnh , a thunderous whip.

Agrik and his servants occupy the great fortress of Balgashang, believed to be located on Yashain, but also thought to reside in several worlds or places at once. Deep within the castle is Ak-Syt, the dreaded chamber of tortures.

## Church

Believers understand Agrik as the servant of Manrasusha, the amoral First God of primal fire. The prophet Ilpylen first brought word of Agrik to ancient folk, recruiting eight acolytes in his volcanic home realm somewhere in the heart of Lythia. The greatest of these acolytes, Moralin, chronicled Ilpylen's legacy in the Balefire Chronicles.

As members of this early and great missionary religion, combative mendicant groups eventually built temples for protection and support. Soon were established the three tiers-or 'Disciplines'-of its followers: the priests, the attending warriors ( Terahni ), and the laity, the last primarily just a source of donations and recruitment.

## Belief

Followers of Agrik are united through a belief in violence as an act of worship. Since the volcanic home of Ilpylen was the original gateway to Agrik's realm, human sacrifice and murder is seen as an appeasement of Agrik and a communion with this path. Doctrine emphasises martial prowess not only for its clergy, but for the laity as well.

## Sacred Ground

The guise of Agrikan sacred ground reflects the religion's martial theology-stout fortresses nearly indistinguishable from other secular keeps. Most temples have eight chambers, each more elaborate the closer it is to the heart of the structure.

Sacred Objects : fire, smoke, ash, sand, lava, obsidian, steel, whip.

## Clergy

The High Priest of a temple is supported by eight masters of different spheres-Master of Acolytes, Maintenance, Treasures, Archives, Propagation; and one for each of the High, Middle, and Low Disciplines. Free Priests also exist independently of a single temple, serving as mendicant spies for the church's central bureaucracy. The Terahni warriors are organised into fighting orders, each located near their sponsoring clerical order.

## doctrine

Low : Shock. Middle : Melee, Morale Roll. High : Command, Initiative.

## temple tongue

Clergy achieve fluency in Surikal , the language used in their ceremonies. In Ceremony and Festival benedictions, an attending priest may use Surikal ML instead of the service type's attribute to generate the Style Secondary Roll.

## servants

The spirits serving Agrik are all violent and bloodthirsty.

Paméshlu : demon-lord of frenzy and excess, Agrik's chief lieutenant is portrayed as an ordinary human clad in lacquered black armour, bearing broadsword and shield.

The V'hîr : the demonic legions of fire and shadow who carry out Agrik's battles. They are divided into eight Orders according to power and size, although all vaguely resemble Agrik himself.

## the uncanny

Agrik most commonly manipulates firesudden kindlings, unlikely ignitions, bizarre forms. This prevalence extends to the sight and smell of smoke and ash, too. More broadly, uncanny miracles also express destruction and devastation, including extraordinarily timed minor quakes or distant meteor showers.

dazzing nreworks, and great combative ritual and sacrifice.

## balefire disciplines

The ceremonies stemming from the Balefire Chronicles fall into three groups, all of which exalt the reception and infliction of pain:

## low ceremonies

Cler:

Ritu obje

and

Dates:

�

Circle: -

Worship:

Oration · Solitary Prayer

Led by the Master of the Low Discipline ( Aperhanar ), the Low Ceremonies are open to all followers and consist of canted, responsive prayer and symbolic man-toman or man-to-beast combat, lasting about an hour. Ablutions utilise sand or powdered lava, and small quantities of sulphur are often burnt. Wealthier temples able to include pyrotechnic displays may, optionally, worship as a spectacle.

Solitary Prayer at a temple takes place in one of eight chambers according to the level of donation. The outer chamber contains a small altar and bowl (+5 consecration bonus); the eighth is a shrine of lavish decoration, with the High Priest often present to lead private group services (+25 consecration bonus).

Sometimes a Low Ceremony includes real sacrificial combat (see the Gateway of Ilpylen Ordeal, below).

## middle ceremonies

Dates:

8

Circle:

Clergy II · Fighting Order I

Worship:

(Martial) Dance

Low Circle clergy (II) and all members of the Terahni (fighting orders) also reenact mythological and historical combats, led by the Master of the Middle Discipline ( Aperterahn ). These very physical rituals last around two hours and involve as much complexity as an oration, with the actors performing precise movements and manoeuvres.

## high ceremonies

Dates:

8

Circle:

Clergy III

Worship:

(Martial) Dance

The Master of the High Discipline ( Aperagris ) leads the priests in acting out planned or anticipated battles sometimes believed to be centuries in the future. These martial rituals last about two hours, keeping the clergy ever prepared for war.

A High Ceremony includes either real sacrificial combat or the torture and immolation of a victim (in either case, see the Gateway of Ilpylen Ordeal, below).

## festivals

## feast of balefire

Date:

� Agrazhar

Circle: -

Worship:

Spectacle

This most important yearly festival, open to all followers, involves many bonfires, dazzling fireworks, and great combative ritual and sacrifice.

## ordeals

## gateway of ilpýlen

Type:

Minor Sacrifice

Devotee:

Follower

Agrikan ritual human sacrifice is named after the religion's first prophet, who challenged the faithful to combat on the rim of a volcano. The loser fell into the 'gateway' as an appeasement to Agrik.

When accompanying a low ceremony, the ordeal consists of ritual combat between a Circle III+ priest and an unarmed victim. When performed with a high ceremony, the sacrifice is either through similar ritual combat or simple human torture. The chance to complete either version of Gateway is a 'reward' usually not granted to the same follower more than once a year.

Feat : achieve victory in the combat (combat ritual); or perform the torture (torture ritual).

## pàmesáni games

Type:

Substantial Trial

Devotee:

Follower

Named after Agrik's chief underling, the Pamesani Games celebrate frenzy, excess, and bloodlust. Widely banned in many realms, these 'games' still find regular church sponsorship in many locales, often in arenas expressly built for them.

Feat : achieve victory in gladiatorial combat.

## ritual devotions

## consecration

Circle:

Clergy III

Clergy of Circle III or higher learn the Ritual Devotion to bless locations and objects, turning them into Sacred Ground and Sacred Objects, respectively. See Consecration (page 320).

## summon v'hîr

Circle:

Clergy IV

Clergy of Circle IV or higher who lead and complete the High Ceremonies of the Balefire Disciplines may then use the arcane mysteries to summon V'hiri, terrible spirits they believe to be servants of their god (page 324).

## haléa

Empress of Opulence · Queen of Pleasure and Self-Fulfilment · Maker of Bargains · Guardian of the Treasure Hoards of Heaven · Enslaver of Hearts and Loins · Golden Temptress of the Crimson Chamber

Halea is the amoral god of wealth and hedonistic pleasure. Usually portrayed as a lithesome and beautiful human female, the Enslaver of Hearts and Loins is shrewd and sophisticated. Although more than just a symbol for sensuality, she is often mistaken as unwise and naive-a facade used deviously against those who ignorantly misjudge her.

Halea resides in Corsilea, an opulently decorated palace of seven levels made of crystalline walls. Devout who have been admitted after death occupy the first five levels, where, with mortal bodies restored and perfected, they spend eternity in a festival of food, art, and sensual pleasure. The sixth level of Corsilea comprises the treasure vault of the gods, while the Crimson Chamber occupies the uppermost level, where Halea and her various companions reside.

## Church

Religions and cults of hedonism date back to ancient times. Most of them likely worshipped an Aspect of hal . It was not until the third century tr that Merodyne the Pale, the concubine slave of a wealthy Karejian merchant, established the church. She gained control of his estates in Livelis and hosted lavish feasts and orgies, claiming her wealth grew out of Halea's blessing.

Her disciples travelled widely, spreading the doctrine of gaining wealth and pleasure through bargains with the Empress of Opulence. Upon Merodyne's death, the first Pontificate was founded in Helas by her primary devotee, Aurelia. The Temenesa Decree of tr 384 established that only women could become Halean priests.

## Belief

There is little demand for right and wrong in the followers of Halea. The most revered ethic is simply fealty to her. She attracts sensualists and materialists, clearly, but is also worshipped by those talented in conspiracy and drawn to the halls of power.

## Sacred Ground

Halean temples form the basic unit of organisation in the church. The edifices mimic the celestial splendour of Corsilea as beautiful places of pleasure in the corporeal world. The ritual hall is usually circular or oval in design. They are perhaps one of the most prevalent temples in the realms where they exist-even small towns often feature one.

Sacred Objects : incense, perfume, bells, coins, jewels, robe, sash.

## Clergy

Seven temple offices symbolise Halea's seven handmaidens. The Queen Mistress of the Temple, the high priest, is served by the Mistresses of Silk and Gold (treasurer); the Luxuriant Page (archivist); Discipline (security); Golden Banquet (high ritual leader); Harmonies (low ritual leader); and Acolytes (training). Priestesses are then usually assigned to one of the Mistresses according to their talents. Sometimes one is appointed to serve outside the temple in the employment of a single wealthy family as a private chaplain.

Acolytes are usually recruited as teenagers, often from the family of a devotee or perhaps a wealthy merchant. They all share a notable physical beauty, and even the temple guardthe all-male Solithar -are recruited at least as much for their looks as their martial prowess.

The Tevól-Hilén (Council of Fragrant Gold) consists of �� priestesses appointed by the Hilenea, usually with a wide geographical representation. They help run the central church bureaucracy.

## doctrine

Low : any Art (Dancing, Drawing, Musician, Singing, Theatrics), Charm, Mercantilism. High : Guile, Intrigue, Physician.

## servants

The servants of Halea are not worshipped-the goddess brooks no rivals. They serve her in Corsilea, and some might appear in mortal planes on an errand or mission.

The Seven Handmaidens : seven princesses serve Halea on the seventh level of Corsilea, each expressing a specific doctrinal element: Dulcia (muse), Elomia (commerce), Galopea (feasts), Sardura (messenger), Selina (wealth), Tania (passion), and Thalia (chance).

The Syverhyn : a race of immortal and beautiful women who once served Halea. They eventually suffered from her jealousy when folk came to worship them instead of the goddess. As revenge, Halea cursed them with giving birth to hideous creatures, called Satyrs , that now populate the world.

## the uncanny

Halea's sense of uncanny includes dizzyingly enjoyable aromas; unsourced yet beautiful sounds of bells or music; and mesmerising sparkles of light, often crimson-hued.

Circle: -

Worship:

Spectacle · Solitary Prayer

The specifics of Halean low ceremonies differ greatly from temple to temple and even ceremony to ceremony. The presiding Yishvina (Mistress of the Harmonies) improvises each time she officiates, making her quick wits and imagination crucial to the event's effect (and producing a varied length each time of 2d6 × 10 minutes). Despite their idiosyncrasies, Shesneala Days share in extravagant regalia and include, in varying degrees, canted response, music, dance, and consumption of sacred wine and food.

Participants who ingest a Strong Potency aphrodisiac, hallucinogen, or stimulant modify the Benediction Roll SV by +1 in relation to figuring the blessing bonus for themselves. Great Potency increases this to +2 SV.

Solitary Prayer at a temple can require a donation in pennies equal to the follower's Wealth. If the amount is at least £1, it also serves as an Ordeal called The Bargainer's Tithe (below).

While nearly all religions accept and depend on donations, Haleanism views it with noted accord, as the concept of wealth occupies much 0f its core tenets.

Feat : make a donation of at least £1 during Shesneala Day. To determine the ordeal's magnitude, multiply the donation's amount (£) by a d10 roll:

| £ × d10 roll   | magnitude             |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| 1-6            | Minor Sacrifice       |

Priestesses learn The Forgotten Acts , ancient techniques of erotic pleasure ranked 1 to 10 in order of complexity and effect. The devotee makes a Halea Ritual (Charm) test, with a penalty equal to the chosen Act's rank × 5 (CS increases the Act's effective rank by 1 in terms of the Feat, below). A CF induces a Shock Roll against a SHK Index equal to the failed Act's rank.

Feat : successfully perform one of the Forgotten Acts. To determine the ordeal's magnitude, multiply the rank of the Act (1-10) by the result of a d10 roll:

| act × d10   | magnitude         |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 1-6         | Minor Trial       |

## ilvîr

Master of Aráka-Kalái · Brooder in the Blasted Plain · The Serpent that Dwells Below · Accursed Lord of the Barren Cycle · Prince of the Fatherless Multitude

Ilvir is the god of creation and creativity, often viewed as a minor deity or even simply a demon. The religion of Ilvir is the only one whose followers believe the god actually dwells on Kethira. He changes shape as it suits him but is most often depicted as a great serpent with many appendages.

Doctrine teaches that Ilvir lives at Araka-Kalai, a series of winding passages and deep caverns below the central region of the isle of Hârn. Here, he spawns the Ivashu, the Fatherless Multitude of reincarnated strange beasts and life forms. It is also believed that Araka-Kalai extends dimensionally to the Blasted Plains, a desert on the world of Yashain.

## Church

Although it is not known when Ilvir ostensibly arrived on Hârn, his presence seems to date back several thousand years. His first dedicated temple was built by Ormanoam, a leader among the initial Jarin who migrated to Hârn from Lythia. Located on an island near the eastern settlement of Arone, the temple stood for a thousand years, only recently destroyed in tr 658 by an Ivinian viking raid.

The church of Ilvir lacks any central authority other than the god himself. There are dozens of orders, many of them consisting of as few as five priests. Even the line between laity and clergy is unclear.

## Belief

Followers of Ilvir develop their own personal view of Kelestia. Doctrine expects no rigid moral code other than simple self-preservation. Clerics are artists and scholars, illuminating manuscripts, weaving complex tapestries, and producing strange carvings. While the religion makes no great demands on its followers, it does not seem to offer much overtly in return. Both followers and clergy truly make their own way.

## Sacred Ground

There is no uniform design to Ilvirian temples. Given that nearly half the clergy are mendicants, there simply are not many permanent locations. Libraries and galleries are not uncommon, but, given the curious form of Ilviran scholasticism, they are more sprawling and disorganised than the similar places of the disciplined Save-K'nor priests. Followers also hold sacred the lairs of Ivashu.

Sacred Objects : craftwork, book, scroll, hide, claw, snake.

## Clergy

Travelling bands of Ilvirian clergy can number more than twenty. They establish small wayward shrines as sacred ground throughout the wilderness. Even when in residence at an actual temple, there are few acolytes and priests, and usually only one 'officer'-the High Priest. While church members do not recognise formal offices beyond High Priest, Circles of Command V through VII still exist as measures of the clergy's knowledge of church secrets and liturgy.

Circle Advancement : to obtain each Circle beyond IV, clergy must first complete the Hail Ivashu Ritual Devotion (page 328).

| VII           | -             | -                |

The Ilviran clergy proportionally consist of far more mendicants than other religions-about half wander alone or in small orders. In the few settled temples, Circle III Temple Priests sometimes take on informal 'offices', such as librarian or keeper of domestic Ivashu.

## doctrine

Low : Animalcraft, any Craft Group skill , Survival High : Ivashi Language , Physician.

## temple tongue

The clergy achieve fluency in Ivashi , the language used in their ceremonies. In Ceremony and Festival benedictions, an attending priest may use Ivashi ML instead of the service type's attribute to generate the Style Secondary Roll. Ivashi is also used by devotees attempting the Hail Ivashu Ordeal.

## ívashù

The fatherless multitude spawned in ArakaKalai are found throughout the isle of Hârn and western Lythia. They come in all shapes and sizes, with many possessing strange powers. All Ivashu seem to understand the Ivashi language-a few even speak it.

Ilviran clergy sometimes attempt to incorporate the beasts into their ceremonies. The success of such varies wildly, with a minimal amount of communication possible through the Ivashi language. Stronger control usually requires arcane methods, such as the Enthral talent or Obedience spell (Savorya II).

## the uncanny

Since the bizarre existence of the Ivashu is already quite real-and thus 'mundane'the uncanny miracles of Ilvir can often be especially disturbing. Physical icons such as claws and snakes could writhe in animation; people's facial features could briefly contort; their bodies might subtly and fleetingly distort. Such expressions usually strike witnesses maddeningly, and their appearance could call for an Aberrance score, with its potential for Psyche stress on witnesses (page 187).

## ceremonies

## mass of ilvîr

The wide-ranging nature of Ilviran ceremonies reflects the variety of the clerical orders and the peculiar habits of individual priests.

## low ceremony

Dates:

One day per month

Circle: -

Worship:

Spectacle · Solitary Prayer

Lay services can take place at any time or day and on different days of the month, depending on the tradition or inclination of the temple or mendicant priest. The day is determined randomly for a given group or leader. The ceremony reoccurs somewhat consistently on this same date each month.

Most services employ a sermon, often as an allegorical tale or song, and include prayer and moments of silent contemplation. However, all ceremonies are dominated by strong theatrical elements and improvisation by priests based upon their unique talents or crafts- the effect instills a wonder of Ilvir's inventiveness. Whatever the form, the ceremony lasts 2d6 × 10 minutes, rolled anew each time.

Laity may undertake Solitary Prayer. This often includes the use of icons, such as a Sundered Claw.

## high ceremony

Dates:

One day per month

Circle:

Clergy III

Worship:

Spectacle · Solitary Prayer

Some orders provide a high mass attended only by clergy-some only provide a high mass, requiring lay followers to worship on their own. In form, they resemble the low masses, except most are conducted in the Ivashi language, and last a little longer (3d6 × 10 minutes, rolled each time). Clergy can even perform the ceremony alone through Solitary Prayer.

A few orders incorporate Ivashu into the worship (see the Hail Ivashu Ordeal).

## festivals

## aráksin

Date:

�6-�� Ilvin

Circle: -

Worship:

Spectacle

This yearly festival takes place in the month of Ilvin between Yaelah (full moon) and Yaelmor (new moon). Throughout the fifteen days, younger clergy perform various original theatrical works that celebrate the Ilviran mythos.

Some performances might incorporate Ivashu (see the Hail Ivashu Ordeal). Leading up to Araksin, clergy often enter several days of solitary fasting and silence (see the Araksin Fast Ordeal).

## ordeals

## aráka-kalái

Type:

(Variable) Pilgrimage

Devotee:

Follower

Most followers try to make a pilgrimage to Arak-Kalai on the isle of Hârn, often timing the arrival with the Araksin Festival. The journey to the Pit of Ilvir is usually made in groups of twenty or more.

Feat : complete the journey to ArakaKalai (the feat is only awarded once per the devotee's lifetime). The ordeal's magnitude varies by how far into the pit the pilgrim makes it, measured by stone monoliths along the path. Multiply the number of stones reached (one to six) by a d10 roll:

| stones × d10   | magnitude              |
|----------------|------------------------|
| 1-8            | Minor Pilgrimage       |

A devotee of at least Circle III  may use the Ivashi language in a Ritual Devotion to attract the attention of a nearby Ivashu. Controlling one is another matter-some Ilvirans may resort to arcane means, such as the Enthral talent or the Obedience spell. See Chapter 7: Bestiary for the details of hailing an Ivashu (page 372).

## laráni

Shieldmaiden of the Worthy Cause · Guardian of Dòlithôr · The Unwilling Warrior · The Lady of Paladins · Protector of the Brave

Larani is the goddess of chivalry and battle. She promotes honour and justice, never striking without warning or cause. The Lady of Paladins embodies duty to one's superiors and respect of one's inferiors. She wears Angcaradian , her blood-red mail; bears Hyvrik , her red and white checkered shield; and wields Avarkiel , the Sword that Strikes True.

Larani dwells in Tirithor, an ideal feudal realm likely on Yashain. From her throne in the castle of Dolithor, Larani commands her followers in battles against predatory realms, such as those of Agrik.

## Church

The legendary origins of the Laranian Church grew out of the exploits of Saint Ambrathas of Alamire. While collapsed from wounds received defending a lady against eight demons, Ambrathas had a vision of the same woman transforming into the goddess Larani. She challenged him with more quests, out of which he attracted the followers who would establish the church upon his death defending its first temple, Alamire.

Several cities claim to be the site of Alamire, but none possess definitive proof. By tr 100, the Laranian church had spread throughout Venarive. Within a century it established itself as a stable defender of the feudal-manorial order.

## Belief

Followers of Larani must be brave, compassionate, and honourable. They value feudal order and are guardians of their culture. Laranians strengthen their service to the chivalric code by sharpening battle skills, whether in tournaments or actual warfare. Gentlefolk often settle issues of conflict through a trial by combat, sometimes fatally.

## Sacred Ground

Laranian church temples are well-organised and self-sufficient, usually including large tracts of land holdings. In many feudal kingdoms they rival the wealth and power of secular lords. Temples are often great stone edifices, resembling and functioning as manor houses. Behind their protective walls stand halls of sacred statuary, devotional chapels, and private sanctuaries.

Sacred Objects : shield, sword, mail/plate/scale armour.

## Clergy

A high priest leads each temple and has three votes on its Council of Five, which also includes four temple priest masters (one each of acolytes, archives, secular affairs, and the fighting order). Varying in number, other temple priests are assigned by the high priest to assist in these four areas.

Acolytes begin service between sixteen and twenty-four years old. They enter a two-year training period that culminates in a special ritual labour, the completion of which usually makes them a Temple Priest.

Clerical Orders : while not all temples are associated with a clerical order, many are founded for special political or theological reasons.

Varáni : the spelling of the religion in Azeri and Karejian is Varani , but the church is identical. Followers practice using the same Ritual skill.

## doctrine

Low : Initiative, Riding. High : Command, Melee, Shock.

## fighting orders

Almost every clerical order sponsors its own fighting order. Members serve as guards in Laranian and Peonian temples or as warriors under the command of a church or secular lord. Fighting Orders maintain chapter houses and some hold formidable keeps.

## servants

Larani's household in Tirithor consists of a variety of warriors and servants.

Méndiz : the demi-divine chamberlain of castle Dolithor takes form as a crimson, winged lion, sometimes sent to the mortal plane.

Válamin : said to be a thoughtful son of Peoni, he counsels Larani in moderation, sometimes serving as a messenger between the two gods. Although rarely visiting the physical worlds, he takes form as a slim young man in white robes.

Knights of Tírith : a company of demigods and former mortals who serve as Larani's royal guard and special emissaries.

## the uncanny

The Laranian uncanny is less overtly bizarre to the faithful and rather more sublimely inspirational, often literally visionary. To enemies, it expresses a wrath through bold distortions of her defenders' arms and armour.

This yearly festival celebrates the foundation of the church by the legendary exploits of the hero Ambrathas, from his defeating the eight demons, to the taking of the castle Alamire from its rapacious warlord. A special ceremony renews the faithful, while priests enter night-long meditation and Solitary Prayer.

Some temples also sponsor tournaments between the faithful to replicate symbolically the saint's deeds (see the Knights of Good Heart Ordeal).

During the Feast of Saint Ambrathas many temples hold a special tournament in addition to the Festival's other events.

Only knighted followers may undertake this Ordeal, which may take the form of a grand melee or a mounted joust. In either case, the combat is meant to be non-lethal.

Feat : render at least one opponent Incapacitated or Unconscious without mortally wounding any, while also remaining conscious.

As part of Soratir or Alamirata, followers may make a confession to a priest in order to purify the soul and renew their faith.

If the confession is serious enough, the priest will assign a penance as either a Minor Trial (such as reciting a litany) or a Substantial Quest (such as performing a dangerous service), according to the severity of the confession. A confession not deemed serious enough will not receive its penance as an Ordeal, nor will followers usually be granted the chance to complete a Minor Penance more than once a year.

## môrgath

Tormentor of the Unlamented Dead · Master of Oblivion · Lord of the Gùlmôrvrin of the Black Pit · Wielder of the Shadow of Incarnate Nothingness

Morgath is the master of chaos. Quick to anger, and prone to randomness, violence, and apparent insanity, he is lord of retribution, but cares little for fairness and justice. Mortals cannot endure the sight of his true form, so they symbolise him with the Durangash , a black orb on a field of brown surrounded by an irregular black border.

Morgathian Hell is called Durakhar (The Black Pole), its location most likely on Yashain. At the heart of its endless maze of horrific tunnels lies Bukrai (the Orb That Cannot Be Viewed)-a black sphere of nothingness and a gate to where the First Gods dwell. Morgath became mad studying the Orb, but not before learning how to impart to his followers the ability to summon its Shadow into their physical worlds. Bestowing this powerful arcane gift brings Morgath the closest of all the Lesser Gods to violating the Concordat . He maniacally hopes for such conflict, as the ensuing war would bring Kelestia back to its natural state of chaos.

## Church

Nearly a thousand years ago the thirteen surviving tomb-raiders of a complex called Urbrath founded a temple somewhere in the mountains of Azeryan. Over the next few centuries, followers were recruited and more temples erected-some say by the very original group of thirteen, who were each strangely long-lived.

Eventually the church refined an attractive core theology for its adherents: the despair of mortality and the damnation of the afterlife were replaced by the rewards of power and wealth made possible by the immortality of undeath. This central tenet was proclaimed in tr 598 in the Thirteen Articles , a move that centralised church authority and elevated the more 'hopeful' Thirteen Amorvrin Incarnations of the undead.

## Belief

Followers of Morgath do not say they love him but rather respect, appease, and dread him. Nearly all harbour a deep psychosis, often the result of long-term participation in the religion's cruel ceremonies.

## Sacred Ground

The church is organised into temples of at least thirteen priests. A typical structure features burial grounds, sepulchres, and tombs, the prominence of which vary according to the level of local proscription. When outlawed, the 'temple' manifests entirely as a wandering, furtive band for whom shallow graves serve as sacred ground.

Sacred Objects : stonework, mask, skin, hide, bone, dagger.

## Clergy

A high priest is advised by a council of twelve underpriests. Each specialises in a particular function of the temple, such as archives, treasures, or training. Each underpriest is served by senior acolytes as messengers and independent mendicants. Lastly, acolytes undertake a rigorous training that, if survived, usually leaves their psyche riven.

Temple Script : the secret Morgathian tongue Ormauk (sidebar) is written in a unique script called Nuvesarl.

Klýss the Necromancer : Morgath's greatest recruiter, Klyss visits the physical world in the form of an emaciated man in black robes shrouding an unnaturally pale face and withered, almost skeletal hands.

Mýrvria the Temptress : the lieutenant of Klyss who bargains directly with unfortunate souls to join the undead ranks as free Amorvrin .

Kôrvakai : remnants of demons summoned by Morgathian priests over the centuries, the Korvakai now inhabit desolate wild lands, such as the ruins of Irkargai in southern Azeryan.

## shadow of búkrai

The Shadow is a horrific ethereal phenomenon produced by either the Orb That Cannot Be Viewed or by the deity himself-theologians are unclear. Certain Morgathian artefacts and minions are imbued with it, and his clergy may summon it arcanely. See page 377 for details.

## the uncanny

Morgath's miraculous gifts of the uncanny often involve putrid odours of the grave out of context, disturbingly animated shadows, and visions of floating black spheres of the void.

The Degrees of Nyardath are high ceremonies that culminate in Morgathian priests attempting to summon the Shadow of Bukrai. While these thirteen ceremonies take place on the same day each month, they are divided into five groups according to increasing levels of complexity, power, and depravity. Each is uniquely named and restricted to a specific Circle of clergy (the highly controlled ceremonies last about 20 minutes per Circle). The Psyche Stress accrued by the participants in the higher groups reflects the increasing amount of unpleasantness at the higher degrees:

Type:

Substantial Trial

Devotee:

Any character

A passage trial for new members, the Kenat-Retsa can occur at any age, but is most desired near or on their thirteenth birthday. For 13 days initiates receive training in prayer and dogma, often visited by the temple's Tormentor for tortured inculcation. Then, at the beginning of the next Shadryn-Vars (low ceremony), the hopefuls kneel before the altar to answer 13 ritual questions from the presiding priest. When done, their names are inscribed in a clay tablet, which is placed upon the altar, signalling their acceptance as the Wreaker's Flesh.

With the trial thus completed, the initiate accrues 3 levels of Psyche Stress (page 188).

Feat

: complete the passage trial.

(Variable) Sacrifice

Devotee:

The Morgathian ordeal of human sacrifice is ominously named after its lay followers: The Wreaker's Flesh . The means vary from throat-cutting to torture to dark rites involving the minions of Morgath. The Intensity of the ordeal reflects the complexity and sadism involved. All, however, feed the Shadow.

Feat : the attending cleric completes the sacrifice. The magnitude of the ordeal is derived from how many levels of Psyche Stress the cleric is willing to accept, a direct reflection of its ghastliness:

## navéh

Lord of the Pitch Shadows · Master of Deceit and Terrible Dreams · Lord of the Last Illusion · Merchant of Death · Trancer the Cat · Wealth's Worry

Naveh is the merciless god of cold and implacable intelligence. He is a master of lies, deception, and darkness. The bringer of nightmares, Naveh is associated with mysterious and sudden death-often worshipped by thieves and assassins. Unlike the violent insanity expressed by Morgath, the Lifter of Lives brings a chilling sense of focus to his mayhem and is seen as a doer of the impossible.

Naveh dwells in the city of Kamil, believed to exist in part on both Kethira and Yashain. Wielding his ebony knife Nava-shak-ara , Naveh commands from his bleak home a host of demonic servants and shades, horrible ethereals sent to corrupt and destroy the lives of mortals in both the physical and spiritual worlds.

## Church

Sacred texts hold that fifteen hundred years ago an eastern Lythian named Sinan prophesised the renewal of war between the gods and Kelestia's inevitable return to chaos. Only those accepting Naveh's discipline would be saved.

Along with that of Agrik and Save-K'nor, the cult of Naveh was one of the first missionary religions. Likely originating out of the primeval fear of darkness and death, the faith spread far and fast, from the initial expression as moon-sky worship to its growth as a temple-state religion. By a thousand years ago, the church had reached followers in every part of Venarive.

## Belief

Followers of Naveh are detached and remorseless. Laity remain withdrawn not only from society, where their religion is widely proscribed, but also from even the Navehan priesthood, who offer them no formal ritual guidance. As for themselves, the clergy lead eremitic, gloomy lives, bonded mostly by a shared, violent misanthropy.

## Sacred Ground

Church temples of Naveh are self-sufficient and isolated from one another. An outlawed faith in many realms, the religion not only celebrates secrecy but usually requires it. Temples most often exist in urban areas, where its members can better conceal themselves. A city's basements, cellars, sewers, and underground passages ideally serve the church's covert, homicidal ceremonies.

Sacred Objects : skull-mask, skulls, dagger, lockpicks.

## Clergy

The High Priest rules the temple with the assistance of five masters, prominent Circle III deacons (see sidebar table). Deacons may normally only advance to one of the five Temple Master offices by killing the current office-holder. This can be by way of formal challenge or a sudden knife in the back. Two Adranatha (the lowest, 'junior' acolytes) are pitted against each other in the temple maze. The one who stalks and injures or kills the other, without being injured themselves, advances to Dranatha (deacon, also called 'senior' acolytes).

Návas-Kâra : this honorary title of Temple Assassin is given to clergy when they have undertaken at least one successful murder of an outsider, whether at the behest of the church or an external client. Navas-Kara are sometimes secretly placed in the households of secular lords, their future potential targets.

## doctrine

Low : Guile, Legerdemain, Stealth. High : Awareness, Melee.

## servants

Naveh controls several types of spirits, most of whom assail their victims in the physical world through Spirit Conflict.

Dekéjis : able to incarnate as a black cat, this powerful demonic servant can see in the dark and perceive heat with its red eyes.

Gytévsha : most dangerous at night, these spirits are either the three named Greater onesGekrish , Krasula , and Vesha -or among the legions of minor Lesser ones who have similar but weaker powers.

Shades : souls of the most devout followers, these spirits sometimes serve Naveh similarly to the Gytevsha.

## the uncanny

The uncanny to Naveh is hellish and cruel. It includes visions of mocking and disembodied skulls, and streams of blood running down walls or flowing against a water's current. Both the faithful and enemies alike might hear whispered voices urging violence and deceit. Witnesses might see sudden passing clouds of darkness, or stark, bizarre colours in Kethira's moon, Yael.

Circle: -

Worship:

Solitary Prayer

While there are no low Services in the church of Naveh, followers may worship through Solitary Prayer. Such contemplation may take place on any day of the month, which itself may change month to month as the follower wishes.

Meditations take place quietly in secret and in utter darkness or deep shadows. They last 1d6 × 10 minutes, varying by the incomprehensible motive of Naveh.

## dezénàka

Dates:

Circle:

Worship:

Spectacle

A high ceremony for priests that takes place on the night of the new moon each month. The high priest leading the Spectacle incorporates pyrotechnic, optical, and mechanical tricks to enhance the 'miraculous' display. Dezenaka rituals always include a blood sacrifice-either an aged priest committing suicide or simply the murder of an innocent. (Treat the latter as a completion of the ordeal Patient Aim of Naveh for the attending high priest). The ceremony lasts 2d6 × 10 minutes each time, ending with the priests consuming a mixture of wine and the blood of the sacrificed. All participants accrue 1 level of Psyche Stress (page 188).

Participants who ingest beforehand the herb Alanal (a Great Hallucinogen) increase the blessing bonus by 2 for themselves-both the received amount and the maximum possible.

Worship:

Spectacle

This yearly festival resembles a more violent Dezenaka . At least three murder victims are selected, one of whom the attending high priest slays, the rest of whom random temple priests are selected to murder. A priest who completes these sacrifices before midnight of the following day (1 Morgat) satisfies both the Patient Aim of Naveh and Shadowmath ordeals (below).

## ordeals

## hêrth-akán

Type: Great Trial (pursued) Substantial Quest (pursuers) Devotee: Any character (pursued) Clergy III (pursuers)

The Herth-Akan is usually a punishment ordeal levelled against miscreant clergy, but is also occasionally used against temple enemies or those the temple has been contracted to kill-the pursued can thus be anyone, even a non-follower.

The pursued is given a one-hour head start to evade the pursuit of seven murderous temple priests, with unsuspecting non-followers given a formal warning of their 'participation'. On surviving the ensuing three days and nights, the pursued completes a Great Trial-and is allowed to live.

The Herth-Akan is also an Ordeal for the pursuing clergy: if they fail to kill the pursued, they all must commit ritual suicide. If they succeed, they accomplish a Substantial Quest.

Feat : live through the successive three days and nights (if the pursued); or kill the pursued within the successive three days and nights (if a pursuer).

From time to time the Dezenaka will include the selection of a temple priest to murder a chosen victim. The high priest engraves several names on the blades of ceremonial daggers, one name per dagger. While concealing the engraved side, the high priest has the selected temple priest randomly choose one of the daggers, which can be used for no purpose but to kill its indicated victim.

Victims may range from the poorest of serfs to the most powerful of lords-social class protects no one from the Patient Aim of Naveh .

Feat : before the next new moon (the 30th of the month), kill the chosen victim using the ceremonial dagger.

## peóni

The Restorer · Bringer of Life Renewed · Lady of Truth · Everliving Daughter of White Virtue · Guardian of the Meek · Lady of Industrious Labours and Ripe Harvest · Confidant of Lovers · Chaste Lady of Honest Love

Peoni is the kind and gentle god of healing and agriculture. She loves those who serve the innocent and powerless and is usually represented as a young girl with hands worn red from labour. Also seen as a nurturing woman, Peoni is symbolised by the fruits of farming and by white flowers, especially daisies.

Peoni resides in Valon, an enchanted meadow in perpetual spring. Believed to be on Yashain, the verdant field is dotted with humble cottages housing the faithful for eternity in their perfect heaven, a reward for a life of hard work.

## Church

Peonians hold that the Lady of Truth summoned four prophets called the Aerlathos, two men and two women, to the ancient world in order to unify the existing, and sometimes violent, earth cults. The priesthood grew out of the devotees who gathered and followed the prophets during their miraculous journeys.

Before the unification brought about by the Aerlathos, the faith was spread by mendicant clerics. Afterwards, temples were built to educate priests safely, starting with the first in Perna, now the church's pontificate in the Kingdom of Trierzon.

## Belief

A gentle theology and the belief that all sins can be forgiven-a doctrine virtually unique to the church-have enabled the Peonian faith to reach a wide following, especially among the humble or forsaken, such as farmers and the poor. Adherents strive to replicate the patience and ardour of their church's greatest saints with acts of sacrifice that benefit their deity, church, or fellow people.

## Sacred Ground

The scattered and semi-autonomous Peonian temples serve as a home base for their priests and a temporary safe haven for the still-numerous ranks of mendicant clergy. While resembling in some ways the great Laranian edifices, Peonian temples are peaceful abbeys, with cloistered walkways and secluded courtyards. Followers also dedicate wilderness shrines to several of her divine servants as wayward sacred ground.

Sacred Objects : seasonal-coloured robe, preserved flower or fruit.

## Clergy

Most of the clergy is divided into the female Order of the Balm of Joy and the male Irreproachable Order , both equal in size and importance. They reside in either separate temples or at least different wings within a common one. Each high priest or priestess chairs a council of other important clergy that includes Masters of Acolytes, of Archives and Treasures, and of Healing. The number of priests in each temple varies but all lead ascetic, celibate lives.

Temple Guards : with Peoni often seen as Larani's mother, warriors of Laranian fighting orders sometimes guard Peonian temples.

Mendicants : obtaining the Circle III office of Reslava requires a test of Ritual (CRE SR) rather than the Ritual (Intrigue SR) on page 315. Characters who begin the game with at least Peoni Ritual ML60 may choose to automatically be such a mendicant. If so, they test Peoni Ritual (CRE SR) Success Value to determine the result of the Reslava-Kai Paledaur ordeal in order to see if they earn Grace (page 336).

Eóni : the spelling of the religion in Azeri and Karejian is Eoni , but the church is identical. Followers practice using the same Ritual skill.

Low : Agriculture, Animalcraft, Physical Recovery Rolls (see the explanation in the description of the Lesser Sapeleh, page 336). High : Herblore, Physician.

## servants

Belsirasin ( The Weeper ): Stern and virtuous, the young warrior sheds a tear for every lie told by mortal folk.

Maermal ( Lord of Labour ): diligent and honest, the huge bronze ox works patiently with the tenacity of common folk.

Tirrala ( Handmaiden of Renewal ): wearied from her labour, the Foremost of Healers appears as a slim young woman holding a surgeon's knife and urn, now the symbols of the Society of Physicians.

Yselda ( The Trothmaker ): wise and humorous, the mistress of honourable love lends guidance to both the betrothed and the unrequited.

## the uncanny

Given her doctrine of peace and calm, Peoni usually expresses even uncanny miracles subtly. Injuries and ailments might heal especially quickly (halve their usual periods). Animals, even wild beasts, might exhibit folk-like actions and preternatural understanding. Her aegis of calm might include the weather, such as quelling otherwise dangerous storms.

Peonian mendicants ( Reslava ) are priests not bound to a temple who widely travel the outside world. Any Clergy of at least Circle III may become a mendicant by passing the Reslava-Kai Peledaur -the Ritual of the Passage of Humble Soul.

Presided over by a group of four temple priests, the follower spends four days completing menial tasks, fasting, and avowing silence. The candidate is ritually bathed and gives praise to the seasons with a sip of water while facing in turn each of the four cardinal directions.

After a four-hour vigil, the follower demonstrates mastery of the Peonian mysteries by presenting a Labour of Reverence , an original prayer, hymn, or work of art dedicated to the glory of Peoni. If the Labour is accepted, the devotee receives the Reslava Anama , a silver tetrahedral amulet, and then exits the temple through the Reslavannon , the 'Portal of Mendicants'.

Feat : complete the tasks and vigil. The ordeal's magnitude varies according to the result of a Ritual (Creativity SR) Success Value test (+1 SV if SR succeeds).

## sárajìn

King of the Icy Wind · Lord of the Perilous Quest · Wielder of the Blooded Axe · Master of Frosty Climes · The Grey Slayer

Sarajin is the lord of battlelust and the patron god of the Ivinians, the northern seafaring people whose far-reaching viking raids perfectly reflect their deity's pleasure in war. Seen as a giant, yellow-haired, bearded warrior, Sarajin rides the sled Shalka and wields Fakang , a double-bladed axe capable of producing great earthquakes and storms.

Sarajin now resides in the ice castle Talagaad on Yashain. However, according to myth, he first did battle in the land of Ivinia itself, where he vanquished semi-divine entities called Pradeyalkri. Among the other monsters and demons he had to defeat were his father Skarakyldrik and grandfather Uyessegryn. In a final duel atop Mount Ilbengaad, Sarajin took dominion of Ivinia by decapitating the great serpent Suerlji, lord of the Pradeyalkri.

## Church

Bjarri Threehand was a skald of the second century bt who is said to have died a valiant death in battle and been rewarded with a visit to Talagaad. There he viewed a heaven of never-ending warfare and celebration. Sarajin charged him with returning to the world to spread the word of what awaits courageous warriors.

While the worship of Sarajin is nearly universal in the north, and not uncommon in the lands colonised by Ivinia, there is no true religious organisation to the faith. The closest to a 'pontificate' would be the settlement of Molima, a stronghold of Clan Beldesa in the religious kingdom of Eldeskaal, near Mount Ilbengaad.

## Belief

Ivinians worship Sarajin most explicitly through what is called the Ljarl , a code of honour that stresses courage and loyalty and that the noblest deed is to die in heroic battle. The Ljarl permeates Ivinian culture-to act dishonourably is unthinkable. In addition to bravery, the code promotes revelry and extravagance, harbingers of heavenly Talagaad.

## Sacred Ground

Ivinian communities usually include one freeclan whose clanhouse serves as the temple to Sarajin. Although for most Ivinians the importance of the Ljarl makes religion just a part of everyday life, it is this same clan whose members fill the role of clergy.

Sacred Objects : axe, rune piece, fur, leather, oar, mast.

## Clergy

The Valhakar , the head of the clan chosen to govern the community's religious needs, is effectively the high priest. Other clan members serve as 'clergy' by selecting the Priest occupation, nearly indistinguishable from the rest of the settlement's warriors. Viking expeditions often hire one of these clan priests to accompany them. Their skill in Runecasting is viewed as an important safeguard during such conquests.

Circle Advancement : the Ritual (Intrigue SR) test (page 315) must include Initiative Secondary Modifier. To obtain each Circle beyond IV, clergy must first complete a Song of Lynraal ordeal (page 338).

<!-- image -->

## aspect: kaj

## clergy

The Valhakar serves as 'high priest'; members of the clan serve as the 'priesthood'. Sarajin priests hold no offices but still progress through Circles of Command I-VII.

Skalds : characters whose realm has an Ivinian pantheon may choose the Skald occupation (listed under Harper/Skald, page 42). One Optional Skill DP in step 12 (stage 6) must be spent on Sarajin Ritual, but this single point raises it from SM1 to SM3. Skalds perform a role similar to mendicants in other religions.

## doctrine

Low : Courage (applies to both Initiative and Fear Rolls), Seamanship. High : Command, Melee.

## servants

Sarajin employs many servants throughout Talagaad and the mortal realms.

Pradeyálkri : these entities helped Sarajin in his conquest of Ivinia and are now allowed to serve him in triumph. The most important are Usnarl (Lord of Bears); Njehu (Lord of Whales); and the lupine Jarlak (the Carrion Lord).

Elkýri : the wives and helpmates of Sarajin, once mortal women, now guide to Talagaad the faithful who have died bravely in battle. There are eleven Elkyri currently walking among mortals.

Ávalir : the semi-divine children of Sarajin, born of mortal women. Not likely numbering more than a dozen, most of the Avalir live in the physical world, such as Idjar One Eye , who dwells in his lodge at Idjarheim in Ivinia.

## the uncanny

A sudden but lasting burst of wind to propel a dragonship through becalmed seas; an ameliorative pocket of warmth for travellers struggling through a raging blizzard-these are the uncanny miracles Sarajin might gift to the heroic. Those in a state of grace might have literal visions of the pradeyalkri or conversations with the Elkyri-not in dreams but seemingly in the clear light of day.

Circle: -

Worship:

Oration · Spectacle

Sarajinians reinforce the Ljarlic code of bravery through tales of their god's heroes and divine servants-these myths are called the Eddas . With no formal stricture concerning their frequency, both low and high 'ceremonies' take the form of a story-telling Oration in the community's religious clanhouse, lasting 1d6 × 10 minutes (rolled uniquely each time).

The Eddas may also be expressed by independent skalds, whose songs and epic poems (Spectacle) fulfil the same purpose of reinforcing the Ljarl. These performers need not be members of the priest-clan-some dwell within the clanhouses of powerful lords; some travel alone throughout the land. A skald's 'ceremony' need not take place in the ritual clanhouse, and they are often performed on the eve of battle, sometimes in the field itself. To this end, skalds often develop a Ritual ML that rivals priests.

While the Eddas are not technically divided into 'low' and 'high' versions, followers are still limited in access to Doctrinal subjects accordingly: lay followers and clergy up to Circle II (Low); clergy of Circle III and above (High).

Feat : participate in the semi-ritual combat. Make a Melee (Initiative SR) Success Value test (+1 SV if SR succeeds) to see if the participant suffers an injury:

| sv   | injury sustained   | injury sustained          |
|------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| ≤ 2  | G5                 | Determine the location by |

| 9+   | None               | None                      |

If the devotee participates in the ritual combat, the feat is fulfilled-regardless of whether an injury is sustained. All participants are lightly armoured, so Armour Value does not affect the SV test.

## sávè-k'nôr

Sage of the Gods · The Lost Guide · Lord of Puzzles, Conundrums, and Mazes · Lord of Jesters · Mixer of Potions · Keeper of the Vâr-Hyvrák

Save-K'nor is the arbiter of the Ke'lha-Hy-Var-Hyvrak , the Concordat of the Illimitable Tome. This agreement between the gods keeps the universe from returning to Chaos, but limits their actions against each other and in mortal lives. Save-K'nor is usually depicted as an old sage bearing Uhla , the lantern that gives no light, symbolic of the neverending quest for knowledge and the futility of finding absolute truth. Other guises include Redira the Jester and Omono the Beggar.

Save-K'nor inhabits Inor Teth, a massive blocky edifice believed to lie on Yashain. Its chambers and hallways are inscribed with all the knowledge of people and beasts. If the universe is the Ultimate Maze, Inor Teth is the Penultimate Maze, a model of its secrets. All mortal and divine knowledge is kept in the Var-Hyvrak (The Illimitable Tome), an actual work hidden or kept between the planes-or, as some believe, just a symbol for the wisdom of the deity himself.

## Church

Eilar of Ironoth, the legendary founder of the church, spent nine years as a studious hermit in the wilderness of the Azeryani drylands. During this time the nine Althar visited him, each imparting a special message that, together, gave Eilar the mission to replicate Save-K'nor's heavenly court on the mortal plane.

His three closest disciples eventually formed what became the three Orders of the church: the Hýn-Aelôri (Order of the Sage of Heaven); the Rydequélyn (Order of the Fool); and the Shéa-Al-Aécôr (Order of the Lost Guide). The pontifical seat is the city of Berema in Emelrene.

## Belief

While the laity usually number fewer than the priesthood, all followers value dispassion, focus, curiosity, and originality, and many secular philosophers and Pvarists are among its faithful. While often remaining morally neutral, devotees do appreciate the value of societal stability.

## Sacred Ground

K'norian temples most often reside in larger settlements. Each one is usually dedicated to one of the three Orders, although some house two or three together. They have the appearance of universities, with libraries of scrolls and maps and quiet rooms for private study.

Sacred Objects : tome, scroll, quill, lantern, hexagon.

## Clergy

A temple has several Loremasters (Rowanti), each an expert in at least one field of learning. The six most senior form the Tryahlar, a council overseeing the temple's studies. Its administrative duties, however, fall to five ordinary priests (High Deacon, Keeper of the Holy Lore, Archivist, Councillor, and Seneschal).

Acolytes start out in the Hyn-Aelori, the largest of the three orders. Once mastering six subjects and two scripts, they graduate to the priesthood, when a hexagonal tattoo surrounding their left eye marks them as Haliki. Especially talented students transfer to either the Rydequelyn or Shea-Al-Aecor for more specialised training (sidebar).

## specialised training

After Occupation Skills are assigned in step 12, stage 5 of character generation (page 48), a Priest of Save-K'nor makes a Folklore (CRE SR) Success Value test (+1 SV if SR succeeds). Those who generate at least SV� may join one of two special Orders and receive additional development points in the indicated skills. Apply the DP before moving to step �.

Rydequélyn : Theatrics 2, Musician 3, Singing 1. Shéa-Al-Aécôr : Law 2, Heraldry 2, Intrigue 2.

## servants

Save-K'nor's servants pursue knowledge, whether through discovering mysteries, harbouring secrets, or telling stories.

The Althâr : the nine Judges of the High Archive, the god's chief servants, command the Vaenya and also perform specialised tasks: Althea (The Truthsayer); Argenon (The High Riddler); Bronduschithrin (The Lord of Lies); Deocala, Desaria, and Detasia (The Searchers); Thonahexus (Herald of Inor Teth); and Yerit and Ilyasha (The Teachers).

Vaénya : the Scribes of the High Archive reside in Inor Teth, building new chambers to house the ever-growing knowledge of the universe.

## the uncanny

Save-K'nor sometimes evinces the miraculous through extraordinary, nearly impossible, leaps of insight by those in a state of grace. Strange lights and timely emanations can lead the lost to their destination. A literal X-or hexagon-might reveal the hidden or elucidate the unknown.

## ceremonies

## the velére

Dates:

6

Circle: -

Worship:

Oration

A committee called the Seren, consisting of one loremaster, two priests, and three acolytes, conducts a monthly low ceremony called the Velere . Held half an hour after dusk, and lasting about an hour, the ceremony consists of songs of praise and invocations for guidance.

## the inbârin

Dates:

6

Circle:

Clergy III

Worship:

Oration

The Keeper of the Holy Lore-called the Serini-conducts this high ceremony after the monthly Velere and yearly Keserne . Attended only by priests, the Inbarin begins with a brief period of requests for guidance and chants in chorus of the Prayer of Forthcoming. It then proceeds to an all-night vigil with priests abased before the altar, which contributes to an Ordeal called the Vigil of Forthcoming for each attending priest (see below).

## festivals

## the kesérnè

Date:

� Savor

Circle: -

Worship:

Oration

On 6 Savor followers gather at the temple to celebrate the acts of the Althar and Vaenya and other K'norian saints. Most fast beforehand for at least two days. The festival begins at noon with six hours of silent meditation, and then the Circle III priest called the Keeper of the Holy Lore recites the lengthy history of the deity and the foundation of the church, an oration generally lasting past midnight.

## ordeals

## the hasêrn

Type:

Minor Trial

Devotee:

Follower

From time to time one of the Rowanti gives an evening lecture or seminar to broaden the faithful's knowledge. They generally last two to four hours. Their frequency varies and about half of them are open to all followers, while the others are for clergy only.

Feat : attend the entire Hasern and achieve a CS on a Folklore Test.

## labour of reverence

Date:

At least once per year

Type:

Substantial Trial or Quest

Devotee:

Clergy III

At least once per year, a temple priest submits a Labour of Reverence to the council of Loremasters. It may be an original work of scholarship or art (Trial); or an artifact or text recovered from somewhere (Quest).

For the council to accept an original work, the submitting priest must spend 15 - CRE Index months producing it, and then make a Success Value test reflecting its nature: Folklore (scholarship); any Language (story); any Craft skill (work of art). Recovering an artefact will likely require many tests during the Quest to retrieve it, but, assuming the piece is of value, the council automatically accepts it.

Upon successfully submitting 36 Labours, the priest is elevated to Loremaster (Rowanti). For this calculation, Artefacts count a number equal to their Complexity Level (or equivalent).

Feat : spend the time to make the original work successfully (Trial); or submit in person the artefact (Quest).

## morning ablution

Type:

Minor Trial

Devotee:

Follower

Pious followers begin each day with a ritual ablution to 'wipe clean the slate to write upon new mysteries'. The committee called the Seren leads a mass ablution in the temple, but, even when away, individuals may conduct the ritual alone with their personal ablution bowls.

At dawn devotees anoint with the bowl's water their forehead, each eyelid, the mouth, throat, and heart-the six 'Chambers of Inor Teth'. Theoretically, the follower then meditates until the water dries-but in practice this is usually for about 10 minutes.

Feat : complete the Morning Ablution every day for six months, without fail.

## vigil of forthcoming

## siém

Master of the Lords of Dream · Bringer of Meritorious Dreams and Blessed Forgetfulness · Lord of the Starlit and Thrice Blessed Realm · King of the Uttermost West · Master of the Sundered Ones in Exile · Spirit of the Mist · Neverchanging Lord of the Azure Bowl

Siem is the eldest of the Lesser Gods, and likely the wisest-he was offered guardianship of the Illimitable Tome, but passed this responsibility on to Save-K'nor. Capable of perceiving the future, Siem is the god of oracular dreams. His plans are subtle, if sometimes confusing. He most often appears as an elven lord wearing a green and silver mantle with a wreath of stars on his head. He seems ageless and projects both strength and longing, an aloof bearing reflected in his special kin, the Ælrhin.

Siem sits on a throne atop Mount Sirinar in the Blessed Realm, heaven of the elven-folk, but also an actual place that may be reached before death and returned from. Some believe this might be where elves go during their astral reverie (page 308).

## Church

Technically, there is no church of Siem. Elves have honoured him for as long as their memory, even before the Concordat. Worship likely originated on Midgaad, and later was brought to Kethira when the Ælrhin left that world.

## Belief

Piety is less an alliance with Siem than a reverence for the elements of his reality-nature and wild things. However, even here, some achieve a greater understanding and are deemed enlightened. These might become lone wanderers or creators of great art, the very expression of nature's beauty.

Some humans worship Siem. Scholars, astrologers, pilots, seamen, and people of the wilderness number among the few who do.

## Sacred Ground

Followers of Siem do not keep permanent temples. Rather, the natural locales that embody ethereal forces are considered sacred groundcalled Taur-im-Aina by elves ('faerie circles' by humans). Also paramount to Ælrhin Reverie, such places can vary in form according to the elven subtype and geography. However, Taur-im-Aina are all exposed to the stars to some extent and are within or near trees, whether in groves, dells, thick forests, or among the canopy itself.

Sacred Objects : azure bowl, scarf, garland, wreath, woodworks, star.

## Clergy

There are no elven offices for the clergy of Siem-even the notion of 'clergy' is informal. However, a character who selects the Priest occupation is pursuing an especially close relationship with Siem. Humans have added a very loose structure, calling their priests Inthiar .

Circle Advancement : a Spirit SR replaces the standard Intrigue SR in tests to measure Circle Advancement (page 315). To advance beyond Circle IV, clergy must have successfully completed the Natural Mysteries ordeal (page 342) at least once.

aspect: zem

## clergy

Even without a notion of  clergy and official offices, Siem 'priests' still progress through Circles of Command I-VII.

## doctrine

Low : Awareness, Survival, Stealth. High : Herblore, Tracking.

## doctrine (seréniel)

SerenielThe Judge of Stones -serves Siem and is the semi-autonomous demigod who gifted the Kuzhai with their stonecraft and gemcraft. The dwarves, even less expressively religious than elves, in turn revere him.

Low : Engineering, Jewelcraft, Masonry, Metalcraft, Mineralogy.

High : Shock Roll, Weaponcraft.

## servants

Servants of Siem range from demigods to spirits and even to secret bands of humans dedicated to protecting nature.

Swéldrè ( The Prince of Stars ): the demigod of music, poetry, and writing, credited with creating the script Selenian. When prayed to during Communion , followers of Siem may substitute Discourse, Musician, Script (any), and Singing for the standard Low Doctrine.

The Ilsîri : before the other Lesser Gods took notice of the physical planes, Siem walked among them, giving self-awareness to a wide variety of entities-the Ilsiri. They are ethereal beings of various power: Asiri (Air elementals), Elmithri (Water elementals), Aulamithri (Dream-bearers).

Úthriem Róliri : a group of human followers of Siem found only in the wilderness of the isle of Hârn, the Brotherhood of the Forest is dedicated to protecting nature from its defilers. While the Uthriem Roliri rarely number more than a hundred, their skilful exploits and secretive nature have made them legendary heroes among common folk.

## the uncanny

The miracles of Siem might express themselves in strange patterns of the stars or through their directed illumination. Strange, billowing mists might suddenly form in unlikely places to cloak the imperilled. Brief dreams of those in a state of grace might play out literally upon awakening, presenting effortless solutions. The motion of trees or the flow of water might provide freakish assistance to the petitioner.

## ceremonies

All Ceremony and Festival worship is considered Solitary Prayer.

## communion

Dates: Any Solitary Prayer

Worship:

The only ritual shared by all worshippers of Siem, Communion begins at sunset and lasts one hour during twilight or into early night-time (page 142). During rare polar nights or days, it can begin at any point of the day.

The worship is strictly through Solitary Prayer and includes meditation before a cairn holding a blue bowl filled with water. The follower gazes into the bowl, perhaps receiving visions. Some incorporate singing, music, or dance into the segments of the ceremony.

While Communions are not technically divided into 'low' and 'high' versions, followers are still limited in access to Doctrinal subjects accordingly: lay followers and clergy up to Circle II (Low); clergy from Circle III and above (High).

## night of high perspective

Dates: 15

Siemists consider Yaelah, the night of the full moon, a holy day. Such a Night of High Perspective does not bring a specific Ceremony. Rather, when followers perform a Communion on this day (the 15th of each month), they increase their blessing bonus-and its possible maximum-by 1, reflecting the evening's divinatory vibrancy. When performed on sacred ground, a pale and beautiful light seems to fill the area.

## night of silent renewal

Dates: 30

Siemists hold the 30th of each monththe night of the new moon-as a holy day. While Night of Silent Renewal is not performed as a unique Ceremony in itself, when followers perform it along with Communion on the 30th of the month, they increase their blessing bonus-and its possible maximumby 1. The faithful enjoy an increased clarity and vivacity to their dreams.

## ceremonies (kúzhai)

## mountain's heart

Dates: Any Worship: Solitary Prayer (Kuzhai only)

While the Kuzhai revere Siem, and especially Sereniel, they lack a religious formality to an even greater extent than elves. Dwarves see no need for complex ritual to proclaim their belief in the durability of clan. They worship in solitary meditation for an hour, usually deep underground, in order to connect to this ancestral faith and gain a oneness with the granite of the Mountain's Heart .

## festivals

## night of golden twilight

Dates: 15 Azura Solitary Prayer

Worship:

In most realms of the Ælrhin, the month of Azura marks the turn from summer to autumn, a moment symbolically balanced between birth and death and so charged with great meaning concerning the past and future. Although the Night of Golden Twilight does not outwardly manifest any differently than the evening's Communion and Night of High Perspective , it must take place on sacred ground-at a Taur-imAina. This Solitary Prayer serves as the follower's yearly 'festival' in terms of the renewal of their faith and the opportunity to deepen their knowledge through circle advancement.

## ordeals

## natural mysteries

Type:

Substantial Trial

Devotee:

Follower

The Natural Mysteries are ancient secrets about the ordering of life, attributed to Siem when he roamed Kethira. Such order includes the (apparent) boundary between the physical and spirit worldsbut, more importantly, the call to overcome this very division. Followers of Siem study the Natural Mysteries by achieving Spirit Immersion during an astral journey (page 296).

Feat : complete Spirit Immersion with Principle or Place Energy.

## Cult of the Covenant Pantheon

The Emela are an ethnic group in northwest Venarive. Descendants of the ancient Jarind of central Lythia, they founded the Kingdom of Emelrene over a thousand years ago. The nearby Sinai of Hârn charged them with protecting the mysterious land between the Es rivers, a sacred covenant that has endured to the present day.

The Emela consist of two subgroups: those settled in the towns and manors of the Kingdom of Emelrene, and those who still practice tribal subsistence in the forested mountains. These latter are called the Free Emela-the Emhle in their language-and their wilderness lands span the borders of several realms from Emelrene to Quarphor. These five groups of Emhle are commonly identified by the mountains associated with their home range: the Jerinalian, Luinde, Nadami, Tilame, and Lankori Emhle.

## Religions

The Emhle's guardianship manifests religiously as the Cult of the Covenant. Its pantheon consists of Siem ('Ziem') and a collection of nine Old Gods called the Kuelrhyn . The Jerinalian Emhle most often worship Siem, while the other tribal groups more evenly spread faith among the Old Gods, with Ylvyr the most popular. Edaryr and Ulana are rare religions now; Garanik is recognised but not openly worshipped. Mordar and Vanaer are seen as enemies of the Covenant, warded against rather than revered.

## church

All Covenant religions share the same church hierarchy, whether venerating Siem or one of the Kuelrhyn. While church offices are fewer than in most other pantheons, all Emhle may advance in Circle (see Clergy, below).

The leader of the entire pantheon is the Circle VII Keeper of the Covenant, the Dheria-Isvan . She oversees the cult from Abrelyn, the hallowed mountain citadel in the Jerinalian range of eastern Emelrene. Nearby is another cult edifice, the fortress of Kwanys, which lies amongst the many strange esoteric zones called lællyn .

Morality : all religions have 8+ orthodox Morality, except Ziem (11+); Garanik (5-12); and Mordar and Vanaer (5-10).

## belief

While the separate religions each express their own usual varying focus, the entire Cult of the Covenant is somewhat unique among pantheons in sharing an ancient, unified mission to protect the lands between the Es rivers.

## sacred ground

All elements of the deeply forested mountains of their homelands are viewed as sacred-lofty peaks, hidden rock cairns, loamy soil, shrouded coves, and icy streams.

Sacred Objects : Emelan rowan tree, Edur rose, speckled goose feather, white deer antler, sable marten pelt.

## clergy

All Emhle are at least laity in the Covenant and may advance to Circle I in a religion; most do so informally as a reflection of their strong devotion. Skilled hunters are members of the Covenant's 'fighting order' and may attain up to Circle II. Only the clergy may go above Circle II.

Character Generation : Emhle characters receive Ritual SM2 as a Family Skill (page 47), and Ritual is added to their Background Skills list (page ��). While the Tribal Occupation table (page 29) has no 'Priest' occupation, Emhle priests can develop Ritual skill well in other steps.

The two subgroups of Emelans described on page 343 comprise 62% of the population of the Kingdom of Emelrene-the settled Emela (56%) and the tribal Emhle (6%). The remaining 38% consist of immigrants and their descendants from other realms, such as Shorkyne and Trierzi. These latter folk are often called simply Emelrini.

The Emela and Emelrini worship the gods of the West Venarian Pantheon-namely, Peoni, Larani, Ilvir, Halea, and Ilvir. Nearly all Emela also honour the Cult of the Covenant Pantheon-and the Emhle do so exclusively.

The practices described below belong to the Cult of the Covenant. Thus, they are apropos 1) to that majority of Emela who have selected a Ritual skill devoted to one of the Covenant religions, and 2) to all Emhle characters.

## ceremonies

Ceremonies in all Covenant religions are performed by each follower through Solitary Prayer (page 316 sidebar).

## the covenant

Dates: Varies (see below) Circle: I (Low); II (Mid); III+ (High) Worship: Solitary Prayer

Followers may undertake ceremonial prayer on any day of the month, seeking low blessings (Circle I), mid blessings (Circle II) or high blessings (Circle III+).

They last about an hour. If performing them on a sacred day , followers receive +10 bonus to the prayer's Ritual SV test. Most sacred days are shared by all religions of the pantheon, but a few are limited to the nine Old Gods or just to Ziem:

* The blessing applies to the same rolls as listed in the Lesser Sapeleh ceremony of Peoni (page 336).

† Followers receive the given skill at SM1 if it is not higher	after	Occupation	Skills	(stage	5,	page	48).

‡ Followers receive the given skill at SM2 if it is not higher	after	Occupation	Skills	(stage	5,	page	48).

Covenant Example 1 : Melrina is from a noble family in the city of Berema. She is one of the Emela and recognises both the West Venarian and Cult of the Covenant Pantheons. She has Ritual ML14 as a follower of Save-K'nor, and so her +2 Blessing bonus applies to the Doctrinal subjects provided by that religion. She chooses one, Folklore, after attending the Velere low ceremony (page 340). The bonus lasts 30 days.

Covenant Example 2 : Nolora was born into the Merenal lodge of the tribal Emhle of the Jerinalian Mountains. She worships the Cult of the Covenant Pantheon and has Elarana Ritual ML30. As a Circle II member of the laity (page 343), she may select three Doctrinal subjects, each with +4 Blessing bonus. She has available Awareness (low Covenant), Initiative (mid Covenant), and Tracking (low Elarana). After she performs solitary prayer in the Covenant ceremony, she receives the +4 Blessing bonus in these three skills for the next 30 days.

Covenant Example 3 : Joridh was born into the Palangwaed lodge of the tribal Emhle of the Jerinalian Mountains. He worships the Cult of the Covenant Pantheon and has Ylvyr Ritual ML70. As a Circle III Priest (page 343), he may select four Doctrinal subjects, each with +8 Blessing bonus. He has available Awareness (low Covenant), Initiative (mid Covenant), and Folklore (high Covenant), as well as Survival (low Ylvir) and Timbercraft (high Ylvir). After the solitary prayer Covenant ceremony, he selects Awareness, Folklore, Initiative, and Survival as Doctrinal subjects (for 30 days).

## festivals

Festivals in the Covenant are services led by Circle III or IV priests. The following is an alphabetised list of the religions, with each of their yearly festivals then given in order of their appearance during the year. The date and type of worship are in parentheses after the name.

## beóna

Beóna's Spring Festival (4 Peonu · Oration) :

similar to the Peoni Restoration Festival. similar to the Peoni Harvest

Beóna's Harvest Festival (4 Azura · Spectacle): Festival.

## edâryr

Night of the Seafarer (12 Nuzyæl · Oration) : held at coastal sites, venerating those far away.

Bondsman's Feast (12 Kelen · Spectacle): lords throughout the feudal realms host feasts for their vassals.

## elarána

Elarána's Hunt (25 Nolus · Dance) : a ritualised hunt involving symbolic steps and motions.

Elarána's Feast (17 Larane · Spectacle) : similar to the Larani Feast of Saint Ambrathas, but celebrating instead the founding Covenant heroes.

## gáranik

Gáranik's Fire (8 Agrazhar · Solitary Prayer [Spectacle]) : no longer a mainstream festival for most Covenant members, bonfires are still sometimes lit to drive away Garanik and his servants. In this way, Garanik's Fire serves as a Sacred Day in the Covenant ceremony. Secret worship of Garanik is recently suspected, where the spectacle fires are meant to placate, or even, attract him.

## môrdar

Shadow Morning (1 Morgat · Solitary Prayer [Spectacle]) : mainstream Covenant members celebrate the peaceful rest of the deceased. More of a Sacred Day for them (as for Garanik's Fire, above), the dead are cremated or buried with talismans to prevent Mordar from 'stealing what isn't his'. Although nearly unheard of today, actual followers of Mordar would celebrate Shadow Morning as their yearly spectacle festival, perhaps extending its duration similarly to the Feast of Bukrai (page 332) in the Morgath religion of the West Venarian pantheon.

## úlana

Úlana's Feast (5 Halane · Spectacle): a yearly festival celebrating the pleasures of life; more restrained than the similar Banquet of Delight in the Halea religion

## vanáer

Night of Grey Shadows (30 Navek · Solitary Prayer [Spectacle]) : mainstream Covenant members recognise this day as one of their Sacred Days (see table on previous page), meant specifically to ward against 'He Who Stalks the Night' (Vanaer). The rare Covenant subversive who actually worships Vanaer, and his associated Gytevsha, would celebrate the day as their yearly festival spectacle.

## ylv´yr

Ylvýr's Feast (16 Ilvin · Spectacle) : a feast to prepare for winter.

Night of Ylvýr's Rest (30 Ilvin · Solitary Prayer) : a yearly festival which followers perform individually as solitary prayer; a deep contemplation of winter's rest.

## zârenor

Zârenor's First Gift (6 Nolus · Oration) : a celebration of the gift of the spoken word. Zârenor's Second Gift (6 Savor · Oration) : a celebration of the gift of the written word. Zârenor's Third Gift (6 Navek · Oration) : a celebration of the gift of arcane insight.

## ziém

Night of Golden Twilight (15 Azura · Solitary Prayer) : the festival of the same name in the Siem religion of the West Venarian pantheon (page 342). A majority of the Emhle (65%) are followers of Siem (also spelled Ziem in Emelan). They celebrate the world of beauty and order inspired by Siem, rather than worship the god directly.

## ordeals

All Covenant religions share the Pilgrimage to Abrelyn ordeal. There are many others associated specifically with each religion-two are given as examples.

## natural mysteries

| Type:    | Substantial Trial   |
|----------|---------------------|
| Devotee: | Follower of Ziem    |

The Natural Mysteries are ancient secrets about the ordering of life, attributed to Ziem when he roamed Kethira. Such order includes the (apparent) boundary between the physical and spirit worlds- but, more importantly, the call to overcome this very division. Followers of Ziem study the Natural Mysteries by achieving Spirit Immersion (page 296).

Feat : complete Spirit Immersion with Principle or Place Energy.

## order of the eldest ones

Type: Great Trial Devotee: Circle II Follower of Ylvyr

A subset of Covenant worshippers of Ylvyr monitor the ether-corporeal Da Anchen. To gain admittance, one must face such an 'Eldest One' personally.

Feat : drive off a Da Anchen from its assault in a Lucid Nightmare (page 395).

## pilgrimage to ábrelyn

Type: Substantial Pilgrimage Devotee: Émhlè Covenant member

Settled Emela seek admittance in the Covenant by undertaking pilgrimages to Abrelyn citadel. These long treks usually require guidance from Emhle wardens.

Feat : an Emhle guide leads settled Emelan pilgrims to Abrelyn without the loss of life. Both guide(s) and pilgrims benefit from completing the Ordeal.

## ritual devotions

## consecration

Circle: Clergy III

Clergy of Circle III+ learn the Ritual Devotion to bless locations and objects, turning them into Sacred Ground and Sacred Objects (Consecration, page 320).

## exorcism

Circle: Clergy II to IV (varies)

Emhle of some Covenant religions learn the Ritual Devotion to help victims recover from possession and the Shadow. See Exorcism (page 320).

| religion   | circle   | religion   | circle   |
|------------|----------|------------|----------|
| Beóna      | II       | Ylvýr      | III      |
| Elarána    | IV       | Zârenor    | III      |
| Úlana      | IV       | Ziém       | II       |

## serenity

Circle: Clergy II to IV (varies)

Emhle of the Covenant religions listed below learn a special Ritual Devotion to stiffen a person's resolve when facing aberrant horrors.

| religion   | circle   | religion   | circle   |
|------------|----------|------------|----------|
| Beóna      | III      | Ylvýr      | II       |
| Elarána    | IV       | Zârenor    | III      |
| Úlana      | IV       | Ziém       | III      |

Performing Serenity follows the standard Ritual Devotion routine (page 318) with the following changes:

## ritual devotion roll

- s Willing	recipients	may	reduce	the effect	Aberrance	has	on	them	by	an ABE amount equal to the Circle of the character	performing	the	devotion. Either the performer or target must spend	1	Piety.	This	same	person	may spend	1	more	Piety	to	increase	the ABE	reduction	by	1.
- cs As	for	Success	(S),	except	no	Piety must	be	spent.	Either	the	performer or	target	may	optionally	spend	1	Piety to	improve	the	ABE	reduction	by	one.

## summoning

## Circle: Circle IV

The rare followers of Garanik, Mordar, and Vanaer who attain Circle IV can summon Fire Elementals, the Shadow, and Gytevsha, respectively. The Covenant proscribes the practice, but dark folklore around such rites persists. Such a high priest must have the appropriate Summoning skill, and then follows the routine in Ritual Summoning (page 346), except where noted here.

Gáranik : the step [1] event is solitary prayer of the Covenant ceremony on the 8th of any month; the associated spell is as for Convoke (page 226).

Môrdar : the step [1] event is solitary prayer of the Covenant ceremony on the 13th of any month; the associated spell is as for Shadow Summoning (page 347).

Vanáer : the step [1] event is solitary prayer of the Covenant ceremony on the 30th of any month; the associated spell is as for Gytevsha Summoning (page 347).
