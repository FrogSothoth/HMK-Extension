## Alchemy

Alchemy shares with the other Pvaric Arcane Mysteries the study of ethereal energy. This spectrum includes the elemental principles of Earth, Metal, Fire, Air, Aura, and Water, and the various other principles categorised as Neutral. Whereas incanters such as Pvarists directly channel the principles to cast spells, an alchemist manipulates them from a distance, guiding the energies rather than personally absorbing them. Through complicated and time-consuming processes, alchemists use their Aura to tap the inherent principle found in herbs and minerals in order to produce various elixirs , each of which expresses a unique effect.

Since such a project involves the ethereal energy found in the elixir's ingredients, alchemy is an Esoterica Group skill and thus considered an Arcane Mystery. It is a type of magic, and so most alchemists belong to and are regulated by the Guild of Arcane Lore, at whose chantries they often reside with other arcanists (page 197).

## Concoctions

There are three types of concoctions, the distinction between which helps define the alchemical process.

## mundane concoctions

Several occupations incorporate herbs and minerals into the substances they make or services they performlexigrapher (pigments), perfumer (aromatic flowers), glassworker (soda ash), embalmer (preservatives), mason (limestone). However, this incorporation is not alchemy, but rather, in game terms, simply a part of the occupational skill itself.

Example : although a perfumer might utilise various herbs and minerals, crafting perfume is simply a Success Value test of Perfumery skill. The necessary ingredients are usually purchased from an apothecary and then incorporated into the fragrance.

## exotic concoctions

Certain rarer concoctions, called potions and mixtures , require a Success Value test of Herblore (page 74) or Mineralogy (page 81), respectively. Again, such work is not alchemy-not magical-because it does not require the manipulation of the elemental principles. The ingredients used in potions and mixtures are either much rarer or more volatile or complicated to deal with than those found in mundane concoctions. While 'mundane' themselves, exotic concoctions have unique game effects, such as poison or quicklime. Most of what traditional or tribal shamans and physicians create are these exotic concoctions.

Example : a hunter trekking through a forest might forage for a plant or herb to use in making a salve to treat the burn injuries of an ally. Once the ingredients are gathered, the curative potion requires a Success Value test of Herblore to craft (page 74).

Exotic concoctions made primarily from minerals are called mixtures but are still treated similarly to potions. The substance known as quicklime is an example (page 81).

## esoteric concoctions

The rarest and most powerful concoctions involve the arcane manipulation of the elemental principles found in herbs and minerals. This is alchemy and it is the work of alchemists. Their creations are called elixirs , the manufacture of which requires skill in Alchemy, Herblore, and Mineralogy, and even benefits from the precision of Mathematics.

ALCHEMY

NANG

## elixirs

The creation of elixirs throughout Lythia is founded upon Pvaric philosophy. While all esoteric concoctions involve both herbal and mineral ingredients, an elixir's desired effect requires a formula that distils quite specifically one of the elemental principles, as categorised according to the Pvaric convocations. Thus, an alchemist creates an elixir of Healing by manipulating the Life principle of the Fyvria convocation; or an elixir of Passion by manipulating the Emotion principle of the Savorya convocation.

Since alchemists do not directly channel principle like mages do when casting spells, the formulas for making elixirs are less idiosyncratic and, thus, more widely shared. Moreover, alchemists do not have to attune themselves to the Pvaric convocations-their tangential manipulation of the principles makes this unnecessary. Alchemists learn and teach 35 canonical elixirs , each one representative of a specific Pvaric convocational principle:

## convocation associated principles

| Fývria   | Earth•Life•Death•Growth•Decay                   |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Jmôrvi   | Metal•Mineral•Artifice•Substance•Toxicity       |
| Pèleáhn  | Fire•Heat•Dryness•Smoke•Action                  |
| Lyáhvi   | Air•Light•Illusion•Incorporeality•Sound         |
| Sàvôrya  | Aura•Knowledge•Mind•Emotion•Keléstia            |
| Odívshè  | Water•Cold•Darkness•Silence•Stasis              |
| Neutral  | Artefact•Defence•Dimension•Incantation•Identity |

Even though they are categorised Pvarically, elixirs are not simply consumable versions of spells. Each esoteric concoction produces a unique effect unlike any spell that happens to share the same convocation and principle.

Pvaric spells are more singular to each mage, as reflected by the arcanist's ability to undertake research from their early career to create new convocational spells. Not so with alchemists. Due to a formula's somatic demand for specifically measured ingredients and delicate procedures, alchemists are usually restricted by their obligation to a canon of formulas. Only at the highest level of training do alchemists begin to produce new and unique elixirs. On the other hand, this canonised structure offers an occupational advantage-given proper training and access to the libraries and workshops of a chantry, any alchemist has the potential to make any elixir.

## methodology

The alchemist's work with one of the 35 elixirs is a lengthy undertaking involving very specific, yet shared, methods. This alchemical methodology demands the progressive mastery of five specific tasks. The following table displays the minimum Alchemy Mastery Level (ML) required to perform each task, along with the skills involved:

- cf No	information.
- f Whether	the	concoction	is	mundane	or	not.
- s Whether	the	concoction	is	mundane,	exotic,	or	esoteric.
- cs As	above	plus,	if	esoteric,	the	elixir's	base	Convocation.

Recognise Example : Merela has Alchemy ML12 and Perception ML70, so tests EML50 (70 - 20 Alchemy Secondary Modifier).

## alchemy training

|   ml | task      | skills                                    |
|------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
|   10 | Recognise | Alchemy or Perception (Alchemy)           |
|   20 | Identify  | AlchemySV                                 |
|   40 | Assist    | Alchemy Index                             |
|   60 | Create    | Alchemy SV(Herblore ∙Mineralogy∙Maths SR) |
|  100 | Invent    | Alchemy SV(Herblore ∙Mineralogy∙Maths SR) |

Alchemists follow the rankings of the Guild of Arcane Lore rather than those of Pvarists. An alchemist of some talent usually progresses at the following schedule:

| rank    | status   | years   | alchemyindex   |
|---------|----------|---------|----------------|
| Mavâr   | Student  | 1-6     | 1-5            |
| Satía   | Bachelor | 7-10    | 6-7            |
| Shenâva | Master   | 11-15   | 8-9            |
| Vîrán   | Doctor   | 16+     | 10+            |

## Alchemy Tasks

Given below are the details for the five alchemical tasks. Each includes one to four additional factors, identified by the brown-circled letters:

<!-- image -->

- d The dangerous task runs the risk of Alchemical Dissolution (page 267).
- m The arcanist may not repeat the task on the same target until Alchemy ML increases.
- p The time-consuming task requires the arcanist to follow the Preparation Routine (pages 268-269).
- w The complicated task must take place in an alchemical workshop, either found at the alchemist's chantry of Arcane Lore or privately possessed.

Trauma Effect : all tasks require concentration (page 182), but those undertaken using the long-term Preparation Routine include some exceptions. Any test involved in the process is subject to fatigue penalty, but usually not to impairment from injury, although GMs may consider applying it from hand and arm injuries in long-term tasks.

<!-- image -->

## recognise m

An alchemist first learns to recognise whether a particular unknown concoction is an elixir by examining it as a 1-round action (smelling, stirring, viewing). This tests the higher of either Alchemy or Perception (Alchemy) :

## recognise roll

<!-- image -->

## identify m w

This one-hour examination is done either (1) to acquire more information after a successful Recognise task or (2) to serve in place of a failed Recognise task. The Identify Roll is an Alchemy Success Value test.

## identify roll

| sv   | informationgained                              |
|------|------------------------------------------------|
| ≤ 0  | None                                           |
| 1    | Concoction type: mundane, exotic, or esoteric. |
| 2    | Convocation; and whether canonical or unique.  |
| 3    | Principle and Effects (if canonical elixir).   |
| 4    | Alchemical Strength (if canonical elixir).     |
| 5    | Principle and Effects (if unique elixir).      |
| 6+   | Alchemical Strength (if unique elixir).        |

Each result includes that from lower SV. A canonical elixir refers to one of the 35 listed on pages 271-274; a unique elixir refers to one invented by someone other than the character making the Identify Roll.

## assist

<!-- image -->

Starting at Alchemy ML40, and not before, alchemists may lend assistance to another's test in the Identify, Create, or Invent tasks. As long as their own Alchemy ML is at least half the ML of whom they assist, assistants grant Alchemy Index as a bonus to the acting alchemist's EML. No more than two may lend such assistance at once.

<!-- image -->

## create d p w

Upon reaching ML60, a Satia (Bachelor) of Alchemy learns to create canonical elixirs. Herblore and Mineralogy are Secondary Modifiers in the Alchemy Success Value test, with Mathematics as a Secondary Roll.

<!-- image -->

## invent d p w

At ML100+, a Viran (Doctor) of Alchemy may invent unique elixirs. While they must be distilled from one of the 35 core principles, their effects may be different than the corresponding canonical elixirs.

## alchemical dissolution

When Alchemical Dissolution occurs, the character is exposed to the principle being manipulated. Roll d100 on the following table:

## d100 alchemical dissolution

- 01-60 minor intrusion :	the	elixir's	breakdown	exposes	the	alchemist	to Principle,	causing Aural	Shock 1 (page	190).	While	suffering	Aural	Shock, an	alchemist	cannot	test	any	Esoterica	skill,	which	includes	Alchemy.
- 61-90 serious intrusion :	same	as	01-60,	but	intrusion	inflicts	Aural	Shock	3.
- 91-00 grievous intrusion :	same	as	01-60,	but	it	inflicts	Aural	Shock	5.

Crucial Dissolution : an Alchemical Dissolution Roll ending in a 5 or 0 results in Crucial Dissolution. In addition to suffering the Aural Shock, the character makes a Shock Roll against Shock Index 8 (page 169). It is not unknown for alchemists to perish (SHK ��) from their volatile experiments. If this occurs, the GM could consider including a literal explosion, with effects equal to an AS�� Eruption elixir (page 271).

## olfactory skills

The sense of smell in human folk is only differentiated through training in one of the six Olfactory skills: Alchemy, Brewing, Cookery, Embalming, Herblore, and Perfumery. Perception attribute tests are allowed, but the resulting depth of information does not widely vary between characters of disparate scores and would not reveal the details possible through the Olfactory skills.

Characters make olfactory tests in a wide range of situations, such as noticing a very subtle odour embedded in a tunic or identifying a strange paste. If the phenomenon is truly alchemical, then the character makes the test according to one of the Alchemical Tasks.

When distracted or unalert to the phenomenon, note that Alchemist characters make olfactory tests similarly to other characters (see Awareness, page 66).

Example 1 : Sorel has PER15 (ML75) and Alchemy ML93, his highest olfactory skill. He makes olfactory tests, distracted or otherwise, against ML93 .

Example 2 : Sorel's daughter Merela has PER14 (ML70), Brewing ML23, and Alchemy ML12. Merela makes distracted olfactory 'awareness' tests against ML23 but can test ML70 when closely examining an odour. Because her Alchemy ML is 10+, Merela may also undertake the Recognise alchemical task against EML50 (as explained in the example on page 266) .

## alchemy economics

Although not precisely quantified in the game, the price of elixir ingredients is reflected in the expense required to maintain an alchemical workshop (page 268). Most alchemists rely on patronage to do so, represented by either the resources of their affiliated Guild of Arcane Lore or some other wealthy patron. In either case, as such, an alchemist's elixirs might not strictly 'belong' to themselves. Given the power of their esoteric concoctions, alchemists are also heavily monitored by the Guild through restrictions similar to the Shek-Pvar Laws (page 199). This oversight occurs even when patronage frees them from literal, direct Guild accommodation.

As the Preparation Routine on the next page demonstrates, a single elixir typically takes about a 24-day work month to prepare. And given their roughly four-month, ever degrading 'shelf life', elixirs are usually not prepared until their application is specifically demanded. While there is no established elixir 'market', transactions between the patrons who directly sponsor their creation sometime take place. In these cases, assume a value of 240d per Alchemical Strength (AS).

NANG

## elixir preparation

Elixir preparation requires access to an alchemical workshop; it is impossible to attempt in the field. The workshop contains all the reference texts, ingredients, and expensive equipment the alchemist needs to carry out the complicated venture-the mortars and pestles, the cauldrons and athanors, the crucibles and braziers.

The alchemist's workshop has a star quality equal to the rating of the home Arcane Lore or Shek-Pvar chantry. Characters may also establish a private workshop-their own Wealth determines its quality (minimum Wealth 10).

| alchemyworkshop   | alchemyworkshop   | alchemyworkshop   | alchemyworkshop   |

## Preparation Routine

To create or invent an elixir, an alchemist must complete the following Preparation Routine.

[�] Time : the alchemist spends 10 + 3d6 days preparing the elixir. This consists of about 10 hours each day in the workshop, with only momentary interruptions. The entire span of days has to be unbroken or the alchemist must start the routine over-the processes are quite delicate and unstable and require near-constant attention.

Inventing Elixirs : when inventing an elixir, the alchemist must establish all of its parameters at this point, such as associated principle, use, duration, and effect.

[�] Preparation Modifiers : preparation tasks require an Alchemy (Herblore ∙ Mineralogy ∙ Mathematics SR) Success Value test. Include the following modifiers:

Assistance Modifier : up to two characters who have at least Alchemy ML40 may offer assistance. If their Alchemy ML is at least half the alchemist's, they each may contribute their Index as an Alchemy EML bonus, up to the normal total maximum +10 bonus.

Sunsign Modifier : elixir preparation is affected by the alchemist's own astrological connection to the concoction's related principle. Consult the Elixir Sunsign Modifier table. The modifier that results from comparing the alchemist's sunsign with the convocation of the elixir's principle is applied to the test's Alchemy EML.

Concentration : as long as the alchemist is able to maintain concentration during the 10 hours of actual work on any given day of preparation, then it need not be kept during the other hours of the day.

Neutral	principle	elixirs	have	0	modifier	for	all	sunsigns.

[�] Preparation Roll : at the end of the preparation time, the alchemist tests Preparation EML from step 2.

Mathematics SR : with an Alchemy S or CS (only), increase SV by � if the Mathematics SR succeeds.

Invention : for a unique elixir, reduce SV by � until the inventor successfully completes it once. When the elixir is successfully invented, other privy alchemists reduce SV by � until they complete it once themselves.

## sv preparation roll

- ≤ 2 ruined : the	elixir	preparation	fails.	To	complete	it,	the alchemist	must	begin	the	routine	again	from	the	start.
- 3-4 completed : the	preparation	is	completed.	The	elixir	is	an enchantment and has Alchemical Strength 6 .
- 5 1 augmentation : for	each	star	result,	the	alchemist	can

- separately	against	the	same	TN. 9+ 5

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Critical Failure : on	the	last	day	of	the	preparation	time,	the	alchemist must succeed on a Will SR or	suffer	Alchemical	Dissolution	(page 267).	If	this	does	occur,	the	elixir	is	ruined.

[�] Augmentation Successes : each Augmentation Roll success increases the elixir's Alchemical Strength (AS) by 1. The final sum is called base AS , which can range from AS6 to AS11.

[�] Decay : once completed, most elixirs are in a liquid state of about four ounces; a few are gases like the volatile Fumebomb. Alchemists immediately store them in glass or ceramic vials with cork stoppers (weight: half pound full).

Every �� days after an elixir's completion, make a d�� Decay Roll against its current base AS: a success reduces base AS by �; a failure reduces it by �. When AS is � or less, the elixir loses its enchantment and has no effect.

## elixir use

An elixir is either internally imbibed by a creature or externally applied to an object or creature. Once begun, either process must be completed within one round or the elixir's effect is ruined-there is no 'partial use'.

Duration : once a stored elixir is imbibed or applied, it has either an Instantaneous or Temporary duration, as noted in its entry.

## Imbibed Elixirs

Living creatures imbibe an elixir by either actively ingesting it (1-turn action); or by having another dispense it into them, even if they are unconscious (1-round action). Consuming an elixir is a Pvarically interactive process between its distilled principle and the user's soulthe creature must make an Imbibing Roll by testing Aura or Alchemy . Neither fatigue nor impairment penalty of any kind affects the rolleven Grievous skull injury does not prevent the imbibing effects.

## imbibing roll

## aura or alchemy test

- cf elixir takes effect :	the	imbiber	is	under	the	effect	of	the	elixir	at	AS - 2	but also	suffers	the	Ill	Effect	of	each	active	elixir,	including	the	one	just	imbibed.
- f elixir takes effect :	the	imbiber	is	under	the	effect	of	the	elixir	at	AS - 1.
- s elixir takes effect :	the	imbiber	is	under	the	effect	of	the	elixir	at	AS.
- cs elixir takes effect :	the	imbiber	is	under	the	effect	of	the	elixir	at	AS + 1.

Zero AS : if	the	Imbibing	Roll	reduces	AS	to	0	or	less,	the	elixir	loses	its enchantment-it	has	no	effect.

Refer to the elixir's entry for its specific effect. Also see the Elixir Summary (page 270) for more explanation of the process.

## profusion

When a creature already under the effect of one or more elixirs imbibes another one, the chance for a CF Imbibing Roll increases. A failed test is now a CF on more unit die results than just the regular 5 or 0-the exact number of die results increases according to the additional elixirs imbibed beyond the first (see profusion example in sidebar):

| additional   | units die results   | additional   | units die results   |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| 1 elixir     | 3•5•8•0             | 3 elixirs    | 2•3•4•5•7•8•9•0     |
| 2 elixirs    | 2•3•5•7•8•0         | 4+ elixirs   | all failures = cf   |

Special : see the Elixir Summary on the next page for special cases and exemptions related to Profusion.

## Applied Elixirs

Applied elixirs do not require an Imbibing Roll. They may simply be poured or their vials thrown-follow the rules in the Thrown Weapons entry on page 110 (Glass Vial, 4 oz). Such 'grenades' automatically break upon striking moderately firm surfaces, releasing the contents.

## preparation example

A character with Alchemy ML 75, Herblore ML69, Mineralogy ML 47, and Mathematics ML 64 wishes to create an elixir of Quiescence at a four-star workshop. A 3d6 roll of 14 means the preparation time is 24 days. Base Preparation EML equals 75:

Alchemy 75 + 5 Herblore - 5 Mineralogy

The alchemist has no assistants and a Nadai sunsign. Since the Quiescence elixir involves the distillation of Stasis-an Odivshe principle-the Elixir Sunsign Modifier table contributes a -10 penalty, bringing the final Preparation EML to 65.

The d100 test roll is 42 (S) and the d10 SR against Mathematics Index  6 is 3 (S), resulting in SV8 (Alchemy Index 7 + 0 success + 1 Maths success). The elixir is completed and receives four d10 Augmentation Rolls against TN4 (equal to the four-star workshop). Rolls of 9, 6, 6, and 1 result in +1 to Alchemical Strength, for a base AS7 elixir of Quiescence. It is now stored, and a d10 Decay Roll is made every 30 days thereafter with its AS7 as the initial Target Number (success reduces the AS by 1; failure, by 2).

Once imbibed, the Decay Roll will be based upon the AS as adjusted by the imbiber's test result. See the Quiescence entry for more details (page 273).

## imbibing example

Hired to undertake a series of warehouse surveillance and break-ins, Galmos has been furnished with a Darkvision elixir from a wealthy patron. Although having an Alchemical Strength 8 when originally crafted, the concoction has degraded to AS7 by the time Galmos consumes it in preparation for the missions. His Aura ML55 is tested-a roll of 81 is Failure (F), so the elixir affects him with AS6. As described on page 271, the enchantment gives Galmos normal vision even in darkness out to 30 feet. Every 30 days, the d10 Decay Roll is made against the current AS, starting at AS6.

Profusion : while under the effect of the Darkvision elixir, Galmos consumes a Fireshield. If his Aura test Imbibing Roll fails, it will be a CF on a units die of 3, 5, 8, or 0.

## starting elixirs

Characters with at least Alchemy ML60 at the end of character generation receive half Alchemy Index (rounded down) elixirs already prepared and stored. The player selects from the 35 base elixirs: the first elixir chosen has an AS equal to Alchemy Index, the next one has AS of Alchemy Index - 1, then Alchemy Index - 2, and so on, with AS reduced by 1 for each selection until half Alchemy Index elixirs have been chosen.

## alchemical strength

- Once	prepared,	the	elixir	is stored with a base	Alchemical	Strength	(AS)	from	6	to 11.	Every	30	days	when	so	stored,	a	d10 Decay	Roll	is	made	against	its	current	AS:

f:

-� as s:

-1 as

- An Imbibed elixir adjusts the current AS according	to	the	Imbibing	Roll	(-2	to	+1). Temporary elixirs	are	still	subject	to	a	Decay Roll,	above,	every	30	days,	starting	at	the AS	as	adjusted	by	the	Imbibing	Roll.

Some	Temporary	elixirs	are	also	subject to	AS	loss	when	they	produce	effects.	This loss	is	in	addition	to	that	from	decay.

- Imbibed elixirs with Instantaneous effect	are not	subject	to	AS	decay	even	though	their enchantment	effects	can	last	beyond	the imbibing	(as	with	Healing	or	Poison).
- Applied elixirs	suffer	a	Decay	Roll	while stored.	They	are Instantaneous when used; after	their	effect,	their	enchantment	ends.

## elixir format

<!-- image -->

## elixir summary

The following section summarises the use of elixirs.

## enchantment

Imbibed elixirs	express	arcane	energy, and their enchantment can be lost:

- Temporary	elixirs	lose	enchantment	when their Alchemical Strength (AS) is reduced to	0	or	less.	This	usually	happens	through the	monthly	decay	rolls	or	through	special use-effects	that	reduce	AS.	The Physic elixir is	another	common	way	to	reduce	the	AS of	Temporary	elixirs.
- The	Physic	elixir	can	also	disenchant imbibed elixirs that have Instantaneous effect.	Thus,	a	Physic	elixir	can	remove	or reduce	the	effect	of	a	Poison	elixir.	Even though	the	Poison's	magic	immediately affects	the	imbiber,	the	lingering,	lethal course of the toxin is still enchanted-and still	vulnerable	to	a	Physic's	effect.

Applied elixirs are enchantments but are not	affected	by	a	Physic	elixir.	There	is	no 'lingering'	enchantment	after	its	effect	is finished	manifesting.

## incantations

The	incantations	of	mages	and	invokers can	affect	an	elixir's	enchantment:

- The Detect-Reveal-Dispel triad of Neutral spells	can	affect Temporary elixirs,	whether still	stored	or	in	use.	The	penalty	to	a Dispel	casting	is	derived	from	the	elixir's current	AS,	which	includes	adjustments from	decay	and	imbibing.
- The	Negation	arcane	talent	also	affects Temporary elixirs.
- Instantaneous elixirs are subject to the above	incantations	only	while	stored-but not	once	imbibed	or	applied.

## profusion

- Quiescence,	Physic,	Poison,	and	all	applied elixirs never induce or contribute to profusion.
- Imbibed Instantaneous elixirs other than Physic	and	Poison	induce	profusion	only when	the	imbiber	is	still	under	their	effect.

## acid

Each round Acid is in contact with a substance, make a d10 roll against AS: success inflicts 1 damage; failure, none. In either case, AS lessens by 1.

The damage characteristic varies by substance: weapons (WQ); clothing, armour (AV); flesh ( f burn IL). For other objects, see Object Damage (below). Damage mounts each round. Creatures make a Shock Roll with each new IL. If ingested, Acid is lethal when IL equals one-fifth the body zones the creature has.

If thrown, the vial breaks and causes a 6-inch circle splash, enough to affect a single 10-zone body location.

Principle:

Metal (Jmorvi)

Use:

Applied

Duration:

Instantaneous

Object Damage : once the elixir is poured or splashed on an object, the d10 roll each round implies that its diminishing effect lasts about 30 to 45 seconds. As a guide, any 6-inch object is destroyed after 5 (wood), 7 (metal), or 9 (stone) d10 successes-with fewer successes resulting in proportional 'defacement' or 'weakening'. Thus, a smaller 1-inch metal hinge could be destroyed (2 successes) or damaged enough to be removed (1 success). The magical Acid elixir does not have to mimic Terran chemicals; GM have great leeway in applying unique effects.

## airtap

Imbibers may hold their breath for twice as long (page 183) and accrue fatigue from movement at one-half the rate. This does not affect fatigue from spellcasting, invocation, or reembodiment.

ill effect : imbiber suffers weariness fatigue equal to base AS × 5.

## darkvision

Imbibers project Light principle that gives them normal vision out to current AS ×5 feet no matter how little natural light, even in pitch black. This does not affect the environment itself, so the imbiber can still be hidden by darkness.

ill effect : imbiber suffers half base AS ×5 penalty to the use of vision when outside of shadow or dim light (HP d6 days · HR5).

Principle:

Light (Lyahvi)

Use:

## dreamwalk

Imbibers switch inhabitation from their body to their active soul, changing perspective from the physical to the spirit world. The imbiber's body remains corporeal and in a coma. The soul may Engage the Spirit World for AS rounds before making the Reembodiment Roll (pages 296-300).

ill effect : imbiber suffers Aural Shock 3 after the journey's Reembodiment Roll.

## egosight

The imbiber may touch major artefacts and learn their Ego and whether they suffer Ego Subversion (see the Subvert spell, page 254). Imbibers also realise if an artefact is simply minor (but do not know its powers); and whether a major artefact instead has Will volition (but do not know the precise score).

## equipoise

The powerful elixir of Equipoise enriches one's connection to reality ( Kelestia ). The imbiber's Fate Rolls automatically include a d10 roll against a TN equal to AS: a success increases a successful Fate Roll's benefit by one success level (with no limit to the ultimate star victory). With a successful Fate Roll, a success on the same d10 roll reduces AS by 2; a d10 failure reduces AS by 1. This is in addition to the loss from the monthly Decay Roll. A failed Fate Roll has no effect on AS.

## eruption

This volatile elixir explodes when its container is forcibly smashed (from lobbing or throwing it down ). A noisome, toxic cloud erupts in a 10-foot diameter, inflicting anyone within it at the moment of explosion with Area d4 + AS f burns. The bizarreness of the explosion triggers Morale Rolls in opponents threatened by it nearby, even if not directly injured.

Swallowing an Eruption elixir automatically inflicts Crucial Alchemical Dissolution (page 267) .

## exsiccation

As a 1-turn action, the imbiber exhales Dryness principle in a 5-foot radius. The effect lasts AS minutes and follows the imbiber's movement. Any water within the area turns into ethereal water (page 243). There is no effect on the water content of a being's body within the area. Each exhalation reduces AS by 1, in addition to the loss from the monthly Decay Roll.

## fireshield

The imbiber receives a half AS increase to Armour Value against Fire impact in all locations, including area AV. The increase instead applies as a reduction to Area AV in the Heat Hazard Roll (page 149 sidebar), with an AV0 possible. Half AS ×5 applies as a bonus to Heat Exposure Advance tests (page 185).

## footpad

The elixir muffles the sound of the imbiber's movements, increasing Stealth ML by current AS × 5. Despite the elixir's name, the effect applies to any sort of noisy motion, so it could increase Legerdemain ML if it required silence (perhaps pickpocketing-but not the feat of juggling). The effect also reduces the imbiber's speaking voice-regular speech becomes a whisper; shouting sounds like regular speech. Wielded objects weighing up to half the imbiber's Spirit ML pounds in total are also affected-the ringing clash of a sword would sound like a muffled thump to those nearby.

ill effect : imbiber suffers Aural Shock 1.

## formfix

The imbiber's failed (F or CF) Spellcasting and Invocation Rolls receive a d10 roll against a TN equal to AS. A success increases the failed Spell or Talent success level by one. Formfix elixirs have no effect on successful Spellcasting and Invocation Rolls.

Each successful d10 roll reduces AS by 1. This is in addition to the loss from the monthly Decay Roll.

## ghostsight

Imbibers gain the ability to take Spirit Sensing actions (page 295) while still inhabiting their body.  As a free action on their turn, imbibers can shift perspective from the landscape of the physical world to the astralscape of the spirit world, or back again. The perspective must be one or the other-having both at once is not possible. The imbiber can maintain perspective in the spirit world for no longer than half AS rounds per shift (minimum one round).

Each shift back to the physical world reduces AS by 1, in addition to the loss from the monthly Decay Roll.

## healing

An imbibed Healing elixir imparts three instantaneous effects.

[�] It eliminates all windedness and weariness fatigue ; stops all bleeding; and removes STN, INC, UNC Shock States.

[�] Each instance of physical trauma receives a Healing, Course, or Advance Roll. Each trauma's rolls overlap with similar rolls from other arcane sources. Thus, an injury targeted by Balm (one roll) and a Healing elixir (one roll) together result in only one Healing Roll (although the elixir may offer second and subsequent rolls-see effect [3]).

[�] Each day thereafter, a d10 roll is made against a TN equal to AS. If successful, all traumas receive their applicable test. Whether the d10 roll succeeds or not, the AS is then reduced by 1. The daily d10 roll continues until AS is 0 or all trauma the character suffered the moment the elixir was imbibed are fully healed.

Injuries and ailments also receive their regular, natural Recovery Rolls. However, new trauma suffered during the process is unaffected by the current elixir. A character could imbibe a second Healing concoction to address the new trauma but risks Profusion (page 269).

ill effect : imbiber accrues weakness fatigue equal to base AS × 5. Each successful d10 SR against AS made as part of the elixir's healing routine also removes 5 weakness. Upon the last trauma to heal from the elixir, all weakness fatigue is removed, if any remain.

Principle:

Life (Fyvrian)

Use:

Imbibed

Duration:

Instantaneous

Healing example : having 10 fatigue and an already-treated S2 blunt injury to the skull (HR5), Galmos suffers a bleeding S3 edge strike to the abdomen and falls unconscious. As a 1-round action, an ally administers a Healing AS7 elixir. The unconscious Galmos fails (F) the Imbibing Roll, so the elixir heals with AS6 .

Galmos immediately becomes conscious, recovers from fatigue, and stops bleeding (no Bleeding Roll required). The S3 abdomen injury gets an HR3 Healing Roll (untreated)it fails; the S2 skull receives a Healing Roll with its established HR5-it succeeds, reducing the S2 to M1. After the battle, the ally takes the time to treat the S3 abdomen injury, increasing its HR to 4.

The following day, a d10 roll is made against AS6 . The roll is 4-success, so the two injuries receive Healing Rolls. Both are successful: the skull is fully healed, and the abdomen injury is down to S2. The AS6 drops by 1 each day, with the d10 rolls continuing until AS drops to 0 or the abdomen injury fully heals.

## iceshield

The imbiber receives a half AS increase to Armour Value against Frost impact in all locations, including area AV. This increase helps resist the Cold Hazard Roll (page 149 sidebar). Half AS ×5 applies as a bonus to Cold Shock and Exposure Advance tests (page 185).

## mending

A damaged or broken object or weapon is fully restored. A single elixir may be applied to any number of objects that weigh no more than AS × 2 total pounds. It is usually not thrown-simply poured.

Swallowing a Mending elixir inflicts Alchemical Dissolution (page 267). Crucial Dissolution occurs on a d100 roll ending in [2 · � · 5 · 7 · � · 0].

Principle:

Artifice (Jmorvi)

Use:

## might

The imbiber may exert a burst of power that increases Strength score by 4. In addition to raising Strength ML, a burst affects the following characteristics:

- Strength Impact Modifier
- Heft
- Bow Draw
- Encumbrance Modifier

The strain the elixir puts on the imbiber's physique slightly increases the sensitivity to pain, offsetting any gains to Shock Roll the Strength increase might have offered.

The imbiber freely decides when to exert a burst, even reflexively, such as calling upon it when forced to make a Strength Roll. When exerted, the burst lasts AS rounds, at the end of which AS is reduced by 1. This is in addition to the loss from the monthly Decay Roll.

ill effect : creature suffers half base AS× 5 penalty to Shock Rolls (HP d6 days · HR5).

## mindsalve

The elixir has three instantaneous effects. [�] It removes the following conditions: withdrawing, routed, afraid, terrified, and catatonic.

[�] Each instance of PSY stress gets an immediate Recovery Roll (page 189).

[�] Each day thereafter, a d10 roll is made against a TN equal to AS. A success gives a Recovery Roll to all instances of PSY stress. Whether the roll succeeds or not, AS is reduced by 1. The daily rolls continue until AS is 0 or all stress suffered the moment the elixir was imbibed is removed.

The elixir has no effect on the Shadow. It can remove an associated state of mind, such as catatonic, but does not obviate or ameliorate Shadow Resistance rolls.

ill effect : imbiber accrues weakness fatigue equal to base AS × 5. Each successful d10 roll against AS removes 5 weakness. Upon the last trauma to heal from the elixir, all weakness fatigue is removed, if any remain.

Principle:

Mind (Savorya)

## object aegis

When the elixir is poured on an object weighing no more than AS ×5 pounds, it better resists arcane attunement (page 208) and Psychometry (page 263). An attuner's or invoker's test targeting the object includes a d10 roll against AS. A success decreases the test's success level by one and reduces AS by one. When AS reaches zero, the enchantment ends.

Swallowing an Object Aegis inflicts Alchemical Dissolution (page 267). Crucial Dissolution occurs on a d100 roll ending in [2 · � · 5 · 7 · � · 0].

## poison

The sign of AS modifiers in the Imbibing Roll are reversed: a CS reduces AS by 1, whereas a failure increases it by 1 (F) or 2 (CF). The imbiber then suffers a toxin with a one-round onset and period (HR = 10 - final AS). See Poison &amp; Toxin (page 186). A Poison elixir has no Ill Effect and does not induce Profusion.

## soulbuffer

Soulbuffer absorbs Aural Shock levels that would otherwise effect imbibers who inhabit their body. Each instance reduces the elixir's current AS by an amount equal to the Aural Shock level absorbed. This is in addition to the loss from the Decay Roll. The elixir also absorbs Aural Shock levels that existed before the character imbibed it.

By absorbing Aural Shock, the elixir also protects a being's dormant soul from dissolution. The elixir has no effect on Aural Shock suffered by imbibers while they are inhabiting their soul.

## weakness

This elixir explodes when its container is forcibly smashed (from lobbing or throwing it down). Invisible fumes erupt in a 20-foot diameter. Creatures within it at the moment of explosion have their Strength score reduced by half AS. In addition to lowering Strength ML, this affects the following characteristics:

- Strength Impact Modifier
- Heft
- Draw
- Encumbrance Modifier

The torpor the targets feel decreases their sensitivity to pain. This offsets any penalty to Shock Rolls that the Strength loss might otherwise have caused.

Swallowing a Weakness elixir inflicts Alchemical Dissolution (page 267). Crucial Dissolution occurs on a d100 roll ending in [2 · � · 4 · 5 · 7 · � · � · 0].
