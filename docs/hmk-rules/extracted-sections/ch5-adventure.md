## c h a p t e r   5 Adventure

alios purposefully folds his hands across the short stack of tattered vellum on the table before him, a subtle gesture of defiance to the negotiation. Ulven, master of Scholars' Hall, shifts uneasily in an opposing chair, worried the chance to acquire the ancient Jarind documents is slipping away. He glances at Kalios' implacable grey eyes, idly taps the table, and considers a different tack.

The Emhlen warden Lerelyn marches sombrely along the mountain trail to Abrelyn, the pilgrims she leads nervously attentive to her watchfulness, unable to forget the previous night's horror. The bright sunshine fails to distract them from the encroaching shadow beneath the trees. Erynos, senior among the devotees, encourages them: 'Come, we must go quickly!'

On a clear day in the High Vale of Our Mothers, Kath hunters can usually see the dark line of the Kald river far to the east. Today, however, with thick fog still clinging stubbornly all around, Loxa can barely make out the near shore of Eagle Pond two hundred paces away. How strange to fret about it now, he muses, choking on rising blood and slumping to the wet grass. He doesn't even feel the arrow shaft buried in his chest snap off, now only half-conscious of mail-clad figures emerging from the mist.

## modes of adventure

Characters on Kethira find adventure in many ways. They can wield social influence, embark on great journeys, and engage in dangerous battles, to name a few. Though most exploits combine several such modes, they each have unique game rules. The Adventure chapter explains these in detail, enabling players to game in a wide variety of situations throughout Kethira's many places.

## Influence

Most Kethiran cultures are far from egalitarian. While negotiating their restrictions can prove quite difficult for the underclasses, even the higher classes cannot often express power without some risk. Adventures of influence encompass a number of actions, including mercantile trades, timely missions of diplomacy, and the resolution of conflicting desire.

- A fur trader travels to a remote outpost in the alpine Nethil river valley to barter with a familiar trapper, whose rare pelts will bring certain profit in the coming spring fair. Located at the wilderness nexus of violent nomadic Gargun and rival Anoa tribesmen, the meeting could prove unwise.
- A priestess of Halea navigates carefully the opulent halls of her temple in Rykal, a powerful city state in the southern island chain of Karejia. Serving the Mistress of Discipline, she brokers in the lucrative secrets of voluble patrons and ambitious senior clergy.

## Travel

The three continents of Kethira consist mostly of vast swathes of wilderness. Even the regions more densely settled, such as northwest Venarive, remain predominantly uncultivated and seldom traversed without great care. Ancient ruins and Earthmaster sites lie forgotten in lands not so remote from the few centres of trade. Adventures are had simply by looking for these places-and certainly so upon finding them.

- In the northern tundra and mountain ranges at the frigid crown of eastern Venarive, the Great Altic nomadic tribal people tend vast herds of reindeer. They hold sacred the surrounding peaks of the Muyarh Mountains, sending thither their wisest to brave the ice and commune with ancestors.
- A group of Zhelorians drive a train of buffalo-drawn carts along the jungle trails of central Anzeloria. Headed to the remote city of Koanto-inaccessible to sizeable river-trade-the party of merchants, teamsters, and guards seek fortune in the transport of valuable metals back to the riverhead at N'dalla, over a hundred miles behind them.

## the mysteries

Kethira expresses powerful, yet rare and guarded magic; its gods, by contrast, remain aloof and unmanifest. The arcane, astral, and divine mysteries add monumental texture to the exploits of intrigue, voyage, and conflict.

## artefacts

Both the magic objects crafted by arcanists and the enigmatic tools left by the ancient Earthmasters inspire quests throughout all of Kethira. As exceptional as their makers, most artefacts exhibit unique powers.

## the spirit world

Perhaps the most dangerous adventures do not even take place in the physical world. Journeys to and from the ethereal planes remain clouded in legend in many cultures, save notably for tribal peoples who practice the esoteric shamanic traditions.

## Combat

Combat often arises out of a consequential downturn in the previous two types of adventure-a catastrophic failure of influence leads to a vengeful knife in the dark; a rash misstep in navigation springs a sudden ambush along a narrow trail. Violence can find characters in many other ways, too-as lords raiding neighbouring manors, as vikings marauding rich shipments. Even more frightfully, Kethira harbours the lairs of myriad unnatural beasts, the might of whom is rarely tested.

- An army of the Kingdom of Palithane laid siege to the Trierzi town of Waleden last autumn in revenge for an earlier attack on two of its border keeps. Before the spring thaw and the siege's renewal, the Trierzi defenders wish to send a messenger to a nearby village beyond the invested walls.
- The Emhle lodge master of Pelangwæd leads an expedition to Mount Belemwys atop the Jerinalian range in eastern Emelrene. Charged with containing and combating the fire elementals and drakes found there, the group includes over half the community's highly skilled wardens. There has been no word from them in weeks.

## Trauma

The challenge of facing physical and mental trauma arises out of many situations. Arrow wounds and concussion, disease and the hardships of weather, psyche stress and the precarious tether of one's soul. All are potential threats to the adventurer.
