# Môrvrin

## Môrvrin

At the centre of Morgathian Hell lies Bukrai, the Orb That Cannot Be Viewed , an utter black sphere of nothingness the communion with which drove the deity Morgath mad. Emanating from the Orb is an ethereal phenomenon called the Shadow , which flows from the Orb, through Morgath, and then on to his chief demonic servant, Klyss the Necromancer. Klyss is the Shadow's conduit to the physical world, where it corrupts mortals and turns them into the undead called Morvrin.

## the shadow of búkrai

The Shadow of Bukrai can infuse not only spirits and beings but also certain objects. Klyss has even taught priests arcane mysteries to summon the Shadow. By allowing such black magic, the deity flouts the Concordat of the Illimitable Tome, the agreement among the Lesser Gods to abstain from overt involvement with mortals. Such is the chaos wrought by Bukrai.

## Shadow Strength

Every entity harbouring the Shadow is measured by its Shadow Strength score (SHA). Shadow Strength has no maximum, but its effect on others diminishes with range. Only touching a Shadow entity or being touched by one imparts the full SHA score. Every five feet of distance or fraction thereof to the target reduces SHA by one. If reduced to less than zero, the Shadow has no effect.

| range :   | touch   | 1'-5'   | 6'-1�'   | 11'-15'   | (+5')   |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|-----------|---------|
| rating :  | sha     | sha-1   | sha-2    | sha-3     | ( -1)   |

Daylight : the effect of an entity's SHA is reduced by 2 in natural full daylight or by 1 in natural twilight. Being indoors or within firelight at night has no effect on SHA.

Overlap : a victim affected by several sources at the same time faces the sum of the individual SHA as a single rating.

Example 1 : at night a victim 20 feet away from a SHA4 source faces an effective SHA0.

Example 2 : in full daylight, a victim touched by a SHA4 source while also 5 feet away from a different SHA2 source faces only an effective SHA2-from being touched by the SHA4 source in daylight (4 - 2 = 2). The SHA2 source is reduced to less than zero.

## shadow in the astralscape

In the spirit world the soul of an entity with the Shadow exudes its full strength only against souls engaging it in Spirit Conflict. Otherwise, there is no effect.

The Shadow of an object in the physical world affects souls in the astralscape only when they attempt animation (page 297) with it.

## Resisting the Shadow

Characters in an area affected by the Shadow must test Spirit at the start of their turn. The result applies immediately. Entities themselves possessing Shadow Strength need not test-they are well beyond 'resisting'.

Shadow Depth : apply a penalty to the test equal to 5 times the total Shadow Strength affecting the victim.

## shadow resistance

## spirit - 5 per sha test

- cf0 catatonic: characters	suffer	three	Shadow	Stress	levels (SL 3)	and	are	unaware,	unable	to	move,	act,	or	defend.	A successful Shadow Resistance test at the start of their next turn	forces	them	to	flee	as	if	terrified	(below) ; failure	keeps them	catatonic	and	inflicts	1 SL (retest	each	turn).
- cf5 terrified: characters	suffer	two	Shadow	Stress	levels (SL 2)	and	flee	the	source	at	a	full	Move	if	possible,	with	no Counterstrike	defence	allowed.	Characters	suffer	1	SL	each round	while	still	within	Shadow.	If	safe	from	the	source	for ten	minutes,	the	terrified	condition	is	removed.
- f disturbed: characters	suffer	one	Shadow	Stress	level	(SL 1) and	must	move	out	of	the	Shadow's	effect,	suffering	1	SL each	round	while	still	within	it.	Once	clear,	the	disturbed condition	is	removed.
- s resist the shadow :	characters	resist	the	effect	of	all sources	of	the	Shadow	for	one	round.
- cs immune to shadow :	characters	are	immune	to	the	effect	of all	sources	of	the	Shadow	for	ten	minutes.

See the sidebar on page 378 for an example of resisting the Shadow.

## Shadow Stress Levels

A character who accrues Shadow Stress Levels (SL) suffers both physically from impaired vision and coordination, and mentally from crushing despair.

Shadow Cloud : as soon as characters acquire SL, their vision becomes darkened and blurred, and movements turn sluggish. They suffer a SL × 5 penalty to PER-based tests of vision and AGL-based tests. Dodge, Move, and Stealth instead have a SL × 10 penalty .

Psyche Trait : about 10 minutes after initially acquiring SL from the present encounter, the character gains a permanent Psyche Trait (page 188). During Shadow Recovery there is a chance the trait improves to indefinite.

If the victim already had a Psyche Trait before accruing the SL, then the player and GM might decide to increase its intensity instead of having the character acquire a new trait. In this case, the old trait would increase to an impulse, and an old impulse to a disorder.

## dying with shadow levels

Characters with Shadow Stress Levels who die from any cause must immediately Face the Shadow, just as if they rolled a CF on a Shadow Recovery roll.

## the shadow example

Elben approaches a sarcophagus, the lid of which is a Morgathian relic infused with Shadow Strength 3. When 15 feet away, he makes a Shadow Resistance test against his Spirit ML75 with no penalty. A roll of 85 (CF 5) means he is terrified, fleeing for 10 minutes and accruing two Shadow Stress Levels (SL 2).

Elben immediately suffers the Shadow Cloud (-10 penalty to sight-related PER- and AGL-based skills; -20 penalty to Dodge, Move, and Stealth). After staggering away for ten minutes, he randomly acquires a permanent Angry psyche trait. He eventually emerges from the crypt and reaches safety.

The GM rolls d6 to schedule the first Shadow Recovery Will test: 3 days later. On that day, Elben tests Will ML65, and a roll of 43 removes one SL, lessening the Shadow Cloud penalties to -5/-10. The Angry trait remains.

The next Recovery test is four days later, and, this time, the Will test 73 fails-Elben falls unconscious until the Shadow is expelled (this effectively mutes his anger for the time being). The player notes that Elben only has one Fate Point left, so she saves it in case it is needed to improve a CF roll, to avoid Facing the Shadow.

Unconscious for three more days, Elben then succeeds on the next Will test, removing the final SL and the Shadow Cloud, and so does not hear from Myrvria the Temptress. The player elects to make a Fate Roll, succeeds, and improves this last Will test to CS. Thus, his Angry trait becomes indefinite with d3 PSY levels, and is recovered from separately as Psyche Stress (page 189).

<!-- image -->

## Shadow Recovery

Once having accrued Shadow Stress Levels, characters automatically begin recovery. The consequences to the soul for failure are dire.

Shadow Recovery rolls are Will tests made every d6 days, counted from when the stress was acquired. Throughout recovery the character still suffers from Shadow Cloud and its accompanying penalties (page 377) according to the current amount of SL.

Exorcism : some religions teach clergy a Ritual Devotion called Exorcism (page 320) to give victims a bonus to Shadow Recovery.

## shadow recovery

## will test

- cf face the shadow: recovery	fails;	the	character	selects	one	of	the	three choices	described	when	Facing	the	Shadow	(below).
- f unconscious: no change to accrued SL and the character falls and remains unconscious	until	SL	are	reduced	to	0	or	less.
- s reduce sl by 1 :	if	reduced	to	0,	the	Shadow	is	expelled	and	its	associated penalties	disappear.	The	permanent	Psyche	Trait	remains.
- cs reduce sl by 2 :	if	reduced	to	0	or	less,	the	Shadow	is	expelled	and	its associated	penalties	disappear.	Additionally,	if	the	trait	acquired	from Shadow	exposure	was	new,	then	it	improves	from	Permanent	to	Indefinite (and	the	character	gains	d3	PSY	and	begins	Psyche	Stress	Recovery).

Thus, if the character reduces SL to zero or less without ever rolling a Will CS during Shadow Recovery, then the character retains the Psyche Trait permanently. However, with even just a single CS during recovery, the permanent trait becomes indefinite, now itself undergoing Psyche Stress Recovery with d3 PSY levels (page 189).

## Facing the Shadow

When characters fail to expel the Shadow, it immediately corrupts their bodies. Myrvria the Temptress, a servant of Klyss, forces their souls to Face the Shadow . The victims must make one of three dreadful choices:

| embrace the shadow   | The soul is imprisoned in Durakhar , Morgathian hell. The body keeps its appearance and personality as an undead Amorvrus (page 379), perhaps in time evolving into a demonic Gulmora (page 382).   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| vacate thebody       | The soul unanchors from the body and becomes an active Shade in the spirit world (page 396). Morgathians maycontrol the vacated body as one of the mindless undead called Dalmorvrus (page 381).    |
| accept true death    | The soul unanchors from the body and journeys to the afterlife. The body starts to decay and the Shadowsoonleaves, allowing only a momentforthebodytobecontrolled as a Dalmorvrus (page 381).       |

A being always has these three choices when Facing the Shadow. Not even Morgath or his servants or Bukrai itself have the power to demand undeath.

## Amôrvrin

## The Free Undead • The Grey Undead

An Amorvrus is created when a being facing the Shadow decides to embrace the Shadow (Choice 1, page 378). At that moment the soul becomes captive in the spirit world in Morgathian hell ( Durakhar) . The body, still anchored by the captive soul, then enters the first Shadow Life of its undead existence.

Amorvrin retain all the abilities they possessed before being corrupted. They inhabit their body and have perspective in the physical world. Although Amorvrin retain free will, they must obey Klyss the Necromancer when he calls upon them to advance Morgath's influence in the world. Amorvrin have these characteristics:

Captive Soul : the soul cannot become active, and other souls outside of Durakhar cannot engage it with spirit actions. Since the captive soul remains anchored to a body, Aura still manifests and so its True Form is still detectable from the physical world. An Amorvrus can suffer Aural Shock, such as from its own spellcasting or from being the target of Aural Blast.

Damnation : upon first embracing the Shadow, Amorvrin permanently halve their Morality score (MOR).

Shadow Strength : upon first embracing the Shadow, Amorvrin gain a base Shadow Strength 1 (SHA 1).

Tireless : Amorvrin no longer have to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep. They can still perform these functions-for appearance's sake-but have no need to. They are thus immune to asphyxia, starvation, thirst, sleep deprivation, and fatigue (spellcasting Amorvrin are especially powerful). They also no longer suffer from Shadow Cloud.

Undeath : Amorvrin make Shock Rolls in response to injuries and can suffer impairment. They heal injuries as usual. However, they ignore the Shock States STN, INC, and UNC and are immune to extended shock and anaemia. If they suffer a KIA Shock State from an injury or from bleeding, their body dissolves to powder and disperses to the wind. They then make a Spirit test to begin another Shadow Life (below).

## shadow lives

A being who embraces the Shadow receives the reward of Shadow Life-the ability to be resurrected as an Amorvrus up to 12 times. The first Shadow Life begins 13 hours after the initial choice is made to embrace the Shadow. Each time it suffers KIA Shock, the Amorvrus makes a Spirit test on the Shadow Life table (include -5 penalty for each previous Shadow Life the Amorvrus has had).

## shadow life

## spirit test (-5 per previous shadow life)

- cf0 embrace the shadow : the Amorvrus is resurrected into its next Shadow Life	13	months	later.	This	usually	takes place in some hidden place set aside beforehand-a	crypt	or	special	chamber. If the Amorvrus is resurrected into the thirteenth	Shadow	Life,	it	is	transformed instead into a Gulmora .
- cf5 embrace the shadow : as	above,	but	the resurrection	is	13	fivedays	later	(65	days).
- f embrace the shadow : as	above,	but	the resurrection	is	13	days	later.
- s embrace the shadow : as	above,	but	the resurrection	is	13	hours	later.
- cs soul choice : as a Success above; or ,	the soul	has	the	chance	to	escape	captivity from Durakhar .	If	choosing	to,	it	unanchors from	its	dead	body	(expelling	the	Shadow) and becomes a Shade (page	396).

Upon resurrection to its next Shadow Life, the Amorvrus recovers completely from physical impairment, although scars from old wounds might remain. Amorvrin retain Psyche Stress traits. See the sample Amorvrus on page 383.

## appearance

Each Shadow Life reduces Comeliness by 2. Initially, an Amorvrus resembles its living self but with an unnatural pallor and a slight putrid smell of the grave. With each new Shadow Life, it becomes ghastlier, acquiring a uniform monstrousness shared more and more with other Amorvrin with each subsequent Shadow Life. Those in their twelfth Shadow Life all look essentially like nightmarish, inhuman corpses.

Aberrance : starting in the fourth Shadow Life, Amorvrin begin to express an Aberrance score (ABE) :

| aberrance   | aberrance   | aberrance          |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|
| life        | abe         | description        |
| 1-3         | •           | uglyorflawed       |
| 4-6         | 1           | ghastly orhorrific |
| 7-9         | 2           | uniquelymonstrous  |
| 10-12       | 3           | uniformlymonstrous |

## shadow traits

When an Amorvrus acquires a Shadow Life, roll d12 three times, once for each of the following three traits. If the result is less than or equal to the number of the newly acquired Shadow Life, then the Amorvrus acquires the given trait. Each occurrence stacks with the results of previous lives.

Shadow Strength : increase Shadow Strength (SHA) by 1.

Shadow Penalty : suffer -5 penalty to PER (all senses), EMP, and WIL tests.

Shadow Power : acquire a special Shadow Power (roll d12):

| d12   | shadowpower              |
|-------|--------------------------|
| 1     | arcanetalent             |
| 2     | búkrai artefact (armour) |
| 3-5   | búkrai artefact (blade)  |
| 6     | búkrai artefact (ring)   |
| 7     | búkrai artefact (shield) |
| 8     | cold of bukrai           |
| 9     | extendtheshadow          |
| 10    | gloomofbukrai            |
| 11    | mutetheshadow            |
| 12    | shadowcontrol            |

Duplicate generated powers have an accumulating effect. See the Shadow Powers descriptions (page 380).

Example : for an Amorvrus in the first Shadow Life, three d12 are rolled: 5, 1, and 12. The Amorvrus gains the Shadow Penalty trait (-5 penalty to PER, EMP, and WIL tests).

At the start of the second Shadow Life, three more d12 are rolled: 1, 2, and 8. The Shadow Strength trait increases  from SHA1 to SHA2; and the Shadow Penalty worsens to -10.

a

## shadow resurrection

According to Morgathian scholarship, Amorvrin that are resurrected into their next Shadow Life undergo an arcane phenomenon likely carried out by Klyss the Necromancer. When an Amorvrus' body is destroyed in the physical world, and its captive soul in hell Embraces the Shadow yet again, Klyss is able to reconstitute its body arcanely in the special crypt using Gateway forces. He then reanchors the soul's Aura to the body, thus beginning its next Shadow Life in the physical world.

<!-- image -->

arcane talent :	Klyss	bestows	an	Arcane Talent.	Roll	d10:

## d10 arcane talent

- 1 clairvoyance
- 2 enthral
- 3 hex
- 4 natural attunement
- 5 negation

6

prescience

- 7 psychometry
- 8 sensitivity
- 9 telekinesis
- 10 telepathy

The Amorvrus receives the indicated talent	at	SM5.	If	already	possessed,	the	ML increases	to	either	SB × SM5	or	the	ML	plus one	Mastery	Boost,	whichever	is	greater.

bukrai artefact :	a	blade	(usually	dagger or	sword),	shield,	piece	of	armour,	or	ring becomes infused with a Shadow Strength of one (SHA 1).	The	artefact	appears	alongside newly	resurrected	Amorvrin	in	their	crypt or	hiding	place.	If	obtained	with	the	first Shadow	Life,	then	the	item	could	be	one that was in their possession at the moment of	their	corruption.	A	repeated	instance	of this power for the same artefact increases its SHA	by	1.

The	artefact's	Shadow	Strength	functions like	any	other,	adding	to	other	sources	of Shadow.	Targets	who	receive	an	injury	from a	Bukrai	Blade	also	suffer	a	penalty	to	its Healing	Rolls	and	to	Shadow	Recovery	tests equal	to	the	blade's	SHA × 1� .	This	lasts	until the	injury	heals.

## amôrvrus characters

To	make	an	Amorvrus	player	or	non-player character,	follow	the	regular	generation	steps in Chapter 2 with the following adjustments:

Step 1 :	most	Amorvrin	are	human,	but	all	Folk are	susceptible	to	the	Shadow.	Embracing it,	however,	is	a	choice-unlikely	with	high Morality	characters	and	Ælrhin.

Step 2 : the Age Group selected represents the age when the character Embraced the Shadow and	received	the	1st	Shadow	Life.

If the Amorvrus has existed through more Shadow	Lives,	either	select	the	number;	or	roll two	separate	d12,	the	lowest	result	of	which indicates	its	current	Shadow	Life.

Assume that a single Shadow Life lasts about	20	years-or	roll	6d6	to	determine the	length	randomly.	If	generating	an	NPC Amorvrus	to	fit	a	specific	historical	span, remember	that	very	few	Amorvrin	exist beyond	a	couple	of	centuries-and	these would	be	quite	ghastly-looking.

## shadow powers

cold of bukrai :	as	a	1-turn	action,	the Amorvrus	may	test Spirit to project a chill that	increases	by	10	any	penalty	imposed upon	a	victim's	Shadow	Resistance	test over	the	next	minute.	The	effect	covers	an area	equal	to	the	extent	of	the	Amorvrus' SHA.	This	does	not	increase	SHA,	merely the	resulting	penalty.	For	example,	Cold	of Bukrai	increases	the	penalty	of	being	20	feet from	SHA4	from	0	to	-10;	but	being	25-feet away	still	has	no	effect.

A CS in the Spirit test to use the power increases	the	effect's	penalty	to	20.	A	CF inflicts	the	Amorvrus	with	Aural	Shock	1.

Each	additional	time	Cold	of	Bukrai	is received	as	a	Shadow	Power,	increase	its	ML by	a	Mastery	Boost	and	track	its	ML	apart from	Spirit	ML.

<!-- image -->

Step 10 : generate attributes according to Age Group,	as	usual.	These	were	the	character's 'living'	scores.	Also	make	the	following adjustments	referenced	on	page	379:

## Damnation

- Halve	Morality	(MOR).

## Shadow Strength

- Acquire	a	base	Shadow	Strength	1	(SHA	1).

## Appearance

- Reduce	CML	by	two	per	Shadow	Life.
- Note	whether	there	is	an	Aberrance	score.

## Shadow Traits

- Roll d12 three times for each Shadow Life to determine	acquired	Shadow	Traits.

Step 12 (Skills) :	after	assigning	the	regular Development Points ( dp )	in	stages	[1]	through [8],	an	Amorvrus	repeats	the	5	Veteran dp step once	for	each	Shadow	Life.

Step 13 (Wealth) : add one extra Occupation Wealth	Die-no	matter	the	Shadow	Lives.

extend the shadow :	as	a	1-turn	action,	the Amorvrus	may	test Spirit to increase its SHA by	1	for	one	minute.	Thus,	an	Amorvrus	with SHA4 would impart SHA5 with touch and SHA 0	from	25	feet	away.

A CS in the Spirit test to use the power increases	SHA	by	2	instead	of	1.	A	CF	inflicts the	Amorvrus	with	Aural	Shock	1.

Each additional time Extend the Shadow is	received	as	a	Shadow	Power,	increase	its ML	by	a	Mastery	Boost	and	track	its	ML	apart from	Spirit	ML.

gloom of bukrai :	as	a	1-turn	action,	the Amorvrus	may	test Spirit to project a gloom around it to a distance equal to the extent of	its	SHA.	The	effect	lasts	one	hour	and nullifies	any	SHA	reduction	due	to	daylight. The	effect	is	not	pitch	black	but	rather	like	a murky	translucence.

A CS in the Spirit test to use the power increases	duration	to	Index	hours.	A	CF inflicts	the	Amorvrus	with	Aural	Shock	1.

Each	additional	time	Gloom	of	Bukrai	is received	as	a	Shadow	Power,	increase	its	ML by	a	Mastery	Boost	and	track	its	ML	apart from	Spirit	ML.

mute the shadow :	as	a	1-turn	action,	the Amorvrus	may	test Spirit to reduce its SHA by half for	one	hour	(round	down).	It	may revert	to	its	full	SHA	as	a	free	action.

A CS in the Spirit test to use the power increases	duration	to	Index	hours.	A	CF inflicts	the	Amorvrus	with	Aural	Shock	1.

Each additional time Mute the Shadow is	received	as	a	Shadow	Power,	increase	its ML	by	a	Mastery	Boost	and	track	its	ML	apart from	Spirit	ML.

shadow control :	as	a	free	action,	the Amorvrus	may	issue	a	single	command	to	up to	Spirit	Index	Dalmorvrin	within	Index × 10 feet.	As	a	1-turn	action,	the	Amorvrus	can also issue a command to another Index of Dalmorvrin.	They	automatically	obey	and immediately	take	action	on	the	controller's Initiative	Rank,	after	the	controller.	Once issued	a	command,	a	Dalmorvrus	continues the	action	until	commanded	otherwise. Thus,	Shadow	Control	defines	how	many Dalmorvrus	may	be	controlled	with	each command-there is no limit to the number of	Dalmorvrus	that	could	be	commanded.

Each additional time Shadow Control is received	as	a	Shadow	Power,	the	Amorvrus may	control	Spirit	Index	more	Dalmorvrin with	each	command.

The GM judges just how much action can	be	described	in	a	single	command.	See Dalmorvrin Actions on page 381 for more details.

## Dalmôrvrin

## The Lesser Undead

Dalmorvrin can arise when a being facing the Shadow decides to vacate the body (Choice 2, page 378). The soul becomes an active shade in the spirit world, unanchored from its dead body. Servants of Morgath can then summon the Shadow to help preserve the decaying corpse and control it as a Dalmorvrus. Such Lesser Undead have the following characteristics.

Shadow Strength : Dalmorvrin have Shadow Strength 0 (SHA 0). Only direct body-to-body contact forces victims to make a Shadow Resistance test.

Shadow Zombie : the Lesser Undead no longer have mental attributes or mental skills and so are immune to fear and mind-effects. They also have no sensory Perception. Their bodies are objectsimmune to asphyxia, starvation, thirst, sleep deprivation, fatigue, bleeding, shock, coma, and Shock States.

Aberrance : a freakish appearance from decay gives them 1-4 Aberrance.

## body preservation

The Lesser Undead are rated according to their body's level of decomposition:

| decomposition   | abelevel       | str•dex•agl    |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Minimal         | 1              | -2             |
| Slight          | 2              | -4             |
| Partial         | 3              | -6             |
| Most            | 4              | -8             |
| Whole           | shadowexpelled | shadowexpelled |

According to its level of decomposition, a Dalmorvrus has the given Aberrance and the indicated attribute reduction to Strength, Dexterity, and Agility scores. If the corpse becomes wholly decomposed, the Shadow is permanently expelled-the remains cease to be a Dalmorvrus.

An Embalming Success Value test can extend the decomposition rate (page 69). Embalmers who roll a CF in the SV test must make a Dexterity test; any failure means they touch the corpse and must now Resist the Shadow (page 377).

Morgathian clergy can also summon the Shadow into Dalmorvrin (page 346-347). Each point of SHA slows the rate of decomposition, but only in corpses that are up to Partially decomposed. See the Embalming skill entry for the exact number of days.

## control the shadow

Morgathians command Dalmorvrin using the Shadow Control power (page 380). They may obtain this power in two ways:

- [1]  Amorvrin can get it as a Shadow Trait.
- [2] Morgathian clergy of at least Circle III gain it when they summon the Shadow and as long as they retain Shadow Stress Levels (page 347).

## dalmôrvrin actions

Without the effect of Shadow Control, Dalmorvrin are inert. Using Shadow Control, Morgathians can command Dalmorvrin to perform actions involving Strength, Dexterity, or Agility. The scores are derived from those of the living being who vacated the body, minus the amount from decomposition. Calculate Move as usual, but half Move is the highest rate.

Example : a slightly decomposing corpse that had STR13, DEX9, and AGL14 when it was alive now has STR9, DEX5, AGL10, and ABE2 as a Dalmorvrus. It has Move 50 but a 25-foot highest rate each turn.

Actions can involve tests of STR, DEX, or AGL; or one of the following skills:

| skill    | attribute   |   sm |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Climbing | agl•dex     |    3 |
| Dodge    | agl         |    2 |
| Jumping  | agl•str     |    4 |
| Melee    | dex•agl     |    4 |
| Stealth  | agl         |    2 |
| Throwing | dex         |    2 |

If the skill involves two attributes, average them regularly before multiplying by the SM. With one, the ML is simply ATT × SM. Corpses do not retain living skill MLs. See the sample Dalmorvrus on page 383.

Commands are not telepathic since the Lesser Undead have no minds. Instead, control 'travels' through the connected Shadow between the Morgathian and the undead. Controllers are able to 'wield' their own Shadow to direct them, similarly to how spirits animate objects.

Aura Attraction : Dalmorvrin have no physical sensory awareness, but the Aura of living beings can serve as a beacon. During a Shadow Control command, Morgathians can indicate a target to Dalmorvrin if the undead are within a distance to the target equal to the target's AUR × 5 feet. Dalmorvrin do not seek out AUR on their own, but such a command to move towards or attack a specific source lasts until commanded otherwise.

## inoperable dalmôrvrin

The Lesser Undead become inoperable under three circumstances:

- [1]  Decomposition reduces STR, DEX, or AGL to 0 or less.
- [2]  They suffer a Grievous Injury to the head or torso zone.
- [3]  Total Injury Levels exceed their STR. Area injuries are counted as IL ×5.

Injury impairment otherwise functions as for beings. Dalmorvrin retain their Shadow even when inoperable-testing Embalming can repair them (page 69). Only whole decomposition full-body destruction by fire expels the Shadow from the Dalmorvrus corpse.

## temporary control

When people facing the Shadow accept true death (Choice 3, page 378), the Shadow that corrupted them often lingers in their corpse. This gives Morgathians a brief chance to wield Shadow Control over it.

The moment people select Choice 3, a test of their Spirit determines if and for how long the Shadow lingers:

## choice 3: accept true death

## spirit test

- cf shadow lingers : the	Shadow	temporarily remains;	the	body	is	subject	to	Shadow Control	as	a	Dalmorvrus	with	SHA0.	After 13	hours,	the	Shadow	vacates.
- f shadow lingers : as	above,	but	the Shadow	lingers	for	only	13	minutes.
- s shadow lingers : as	above,	but	the Shadow	lingers	for	only	13	rounds.
- cs shadow vacated: the Shadow vacates the body,	leaving	no	chance	for	control.

a

## tahnarynism

It is unclear exactly how the Shadow functions as the conduit between Dalmorvrin and Morgathians who control them. Several hundred years ago a Bereman Grey Mage named Urbanal Tahnaryn ( c . tr 540) claimed to have discovered what he called an 'antiPrinciple' associated with the Shadow. Contemporary Pvaric accounts of Tahnaryn's lectures say he described the discovery as an 'entropic force' relating to or explaining the Bukrai. Church Inquisitors of Morgath took quick interest and are said to have quashed-or claimed-his research. Tahnaryn himself dropped from the historical record soon after.

## Gùlmôrvrin

## The Unfree Undead

A Gulmora is created when an Amorvrus embraces the Shadow after being killed in its twelfth Shadow Life. The body withers away to dust but is not resurrected in its hiding place. Instead, the soul is sent to the court of Klyss the Necromancer, where, after a thirteen-hour ritual, it becomes an active spirit capable of incarnation in the physical world. The soul is now a dreadful and chaotic Morgathian demon-a Gulmora.

Gulmorvrin have these characteristics:

Active Spirit : a Gulmora is no longer a being but instead an active spirit, commanded by Klyss from the Black Pit of hell. He sends such Unfree Undead on missions both in the spirit world and to the physical world by way of infernal gateways. They are the most fearsome of Morgath's servants and do only his bidding. None have been known to respond to ritual summons or control.

Incarnation : Gulmorvrin can take shape and have perspective in the physical world, most safely at night. See Incarnation for more details (page 393).

Shadow Control : all Gulmorvrin possess the Shadow Control power (page 380).

Shadow Powers : a Gulmora retains the Shadow Powers it had as an Amorvrus. Roll d12 three more times on the Shadow Power table (page 379). Duplicate results are possible. Refigure MLs using its new attributes given in the Demonic Physique section below.

-  Gulmorvrin do not suffer Aural Shock when they roll CF on Shadow Power tests. Instead, a CF leaves them unable to use all Shadow Powers for one hour.

Shadow Strength : a Gulmora has the Shadow Strength (SHA) it possessed as an Amorvrus-plus one. Generate a typical Gulmora's SHA with a 3d6 roll:

| 3d6   |   sha | 3d6   |   sha |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 3     |     4 | 11-12 |     9 |
| 4     |     5 | 13-14 |    10 |
| 5-6   |     6 | 15-16 |    11 |
| 7-8   |     7 | 17    |    12 |
| 9-10  |     8 | 18    |    13 |

Tireless : Gulmorvrin retain the Amorvrus ability of the same name (page 379). They are immune to asphyxia, starvation, thirst, sleep deprivation, and fatigue.

## demonic physique

At the behest of Morgath, Klyss incarnates Gulmorvrin in the physical world to carry out awful tasks. He gives a Gulmora a unique appearance, one that evolves each time it takes form. See the sample on page 384.

The demon no longer necessarily resembles the body it had as an Amorvrus. Whereas Amorvrin in their twelfth lives look nearly identical to each other, a Gulmora begins subtly to take on unique characteristics with each incarnation. It is certainly horrific, perhaps the most aberrant of all entities.

Attributes : when Klyss resurrects an Amorvrus as a Gulmora, he transforms much of its incarnated physique and personality. Regenerate its attributes:

| physical   | physical   | mental   | mental   |
|------------|------------|----------|----------|
| str        | 10+2 d 6   | aur      | 8+2 d 6  |

| abe        | 4+1 d 4    | elo      | 4+1 d 6  |

Damnation : a Gulmora halves MOR it possessed as an Amorvrus .

Skills : Klyss grants Gulmorvrin skills as needed, developed to SM5 + 2 Mastery Boosts (see the example on page 384).

## gùlmôrvrin archetypes

Many Gulmorvrin remain on the world of Yashain as champions in Morgath's celestial war against the forces of good. Some are sent to other worlds to seek converts and carry out secret tasks. Although essentially unique entities, incarnated Unfree Undead often share roles that reflect similarly defined attributes and powers.

Executioners : Klyss sends Gulmorvrin to assassinate blasphemous clergy or to eliminate political targets vexing his master's plans. Such executioners are selected for their dexterity, agility, and will, often exhibiting a creative cunning.

They invariably wield Bukrai blades when carrying out their murders, striking fast and ruthlessly. These Gulmorvrin conjure the Gloom of Bukrai to make even daylight attacks possible.

Inquisitors : the most abstruse missions are handed to Gulmorvrin of the highest intellect and arcane talent. Shrouded in dark tattered robes in homage to their commander, Klyss, these demons carry

## gùlmôra dissolution

When its incarnation is killed or suffers Aural Shock, a Gulmora undergoes dissolution. Test Spirit to determine for how long and whether it can reform:

## gùlmôra dissolution

## spirit test

- cf0 reformed : the Gùlmôra is dissolved for 13 months.	Klyss	then	grants	it	the	ability	to incarnate	in	the	physical	world	with	all	the characteristics	it	previously	had.
- cf5 reformed : as	above,	but	the	dissolution lasts	13	fivedays	(65	days).
- f reformed : as	above,	but	the	dissolution lasts	13	days.
- s reformed : as	above,	but	the	dissolution lasts	13	hours.
- cs incarnation destroyed : the demon can no	longer	take	shape	in	the	physical	world. The	soul	of	such	a	'lost'	Gùlmôra	likely remains	at	the	court	of	Klyss.

Incarnated Gulmorvrin arrive through Gateways connected to Morgathian temples or other secluded places, such as ancient forests or deep urban crypts.

Daylight : Gulmorvrin in broad daylight automatically suffer dissolution. A successful use of the Shadow Power Gloom of Bukrai defers dissolution from such exposure for the duration of the Gloomone (S) or Index (CS) hours.

out investigations throughout the most powerful church circles. Possessing unusually high Shadow Strength, they are unequalled in projecting terror.

Inquisitors are always strong invokers, with Clairvoyance, Enthral, and Telepathy the most commonly expressed talents. The Cold of Bukrai and Extend the Shadow are their favoured Shadow powers.

Wreakers : the most physically mighty Gulmorvrin reach nearly seven feet tall and are aptly Morgath's greatest warriors. While they might not rival the highest orders of Agrikan demons in pure martial prowess, such Wreakers are unmatched in their wanton cruelty and insatiable passion for chaos.

Some wield Bukrai Blades and don dark-plated Armour of Bukrai. Others are endowed with awful claws and ghastly fangs to rend their victims in especial gore.

The hide of all types of Gulmorvrin exhibits preternatural toughness (see the values on page 384). It offers the demons stout protection even when not wearing armour.

## amôrvrus

5′10″ · 160 lbs  medium

The popular son of textile mercantylers, this Grey Undead spent his living youth leading the guards that accompanied his family's trade expeditions. While a blunt command worked well with soldiers, the same disposition later cost him the guild power he felt he deserved. Such bitterness, and a natural corruptibility, led his obscure research as an old man to the fell temptation of Myrvria.

Free Undead : the Amorvrus is in his first Shadow Life, appearing as an unhealthy 60-year old when he is actually over 80. With Shadow Strength one (SHA 1), he functions undetected in society during the day despite the milky gloss to his eyes and sallow complexion.

Impulse (paranoid) : the Amorvrus is extremely paranoid (Will ML60 to suppress it when made even slightly suspicious). He is especially triggered by the machinations of rival mercantylers and the politics of the Mangai. A nearly unhinged cruelty (MOR 4) encourages robust and insidious revenge against a lifetime of perceived slights.

## dalmôrvrus

5′6″ · 120 lbs  medium

A high priest of Morgath performed the Huldath ceremony and applied two points of the summoned Shadow to the corpse of a sacrificed follower. Thus 'born' a few days ago, the Dalmorvrus is only minimally decomposed, one of several awaiting the Khidarmur's command.

Decomposition : the applied SHA2 and an SV7 Embalming test extend the corpse's minimal decomposition in a cool temperate climate to 25 days; and to 34 days for slight ; and to 112 days for partial .

Shadow Strength : victims must Resist the Shadow (SHA 0) only from a direct skin-to-skin touch, or at least an M1 injury from its augmented nails ('claws').

Shamble : the undead can go no faster than a 25-foot half Move. Its Charge action distance is halved to 10 feet.

Trauma : it suffers no fatigue, shock, or bleeding. It becomes inoperable from one Grievous injury to the head or torso; or if total IL exceed 8. It suffers impairment and compound injuries. See Shadow Zombie for other immunities (page 381).

Gloom of Búkrai (1-turn): with a successful Spirit test, the Amorvrus projects a murky shadow five feet around himself. The gloom nullifies the effect of daylight on Shadow Strength for one hour (CS four hours). A CF Spirit test leaves him with Aural Shock 1.

Other Skills : the Amorvrus also has both native and one foreign language ML65; one script ML65; Textilecraft ML44; and Morgath Ritual ML13.

Aura Attraction : if within a target's AUR × 5 feet, Lesser Undead can be commanded to engage it using the target's Aura as a beacon. Once engaged, they can be commanded to attack and counterstrike until told otherwise.

## gùlmôra

6′4″ · 200 lbs  medium

Klyss blessed the incarnation of this Morgathian demon with unusual drive and inventiveness. Combining keen senses with an exceptional nimbleness, the Gulmora pursues missions of stealthy infiltration and surveillance. It stands well over six feet tall and has a gangly but powerful humanoid physique. The grey lustre of its body both cloaks it well in shadows and delimits its ghastly features to the unfortunate witness.

A mobile and graceful climber, the demon remains unburdened with Bukrai blades and items, instead dispatching foes in close quarters with horrific fourinch claws and a fanged maw. However, terrorising folk within the 40-foot reach of its Shadow usually obviates melee.

Aberrance (page 187): there are likely few entities more aberrant to Kethirans than Gulmorvrin. They induce Fear Rolls in creatures on sight; even those able to steady themselves usually do not escape without a horrifically damaged psyche.

Clairvoyance (page 261): the demon has Clairvoyance ML80. Resolve its use with the Invocation routine (page 259). As a gift from Klyss, Critical Failure does not induce Aural Shock but rather simply leaves the Gulmora unable to invoke Clairvoyance for d3 days.

Cold of Bukrai : with a 1-turn action and a successful Spirit test, the Gulmora projects a chill in a 40-foot radius area around itself for one minute. Spirit tests to Resist the Shadow incur an extra -10 penalty (CS -20).

Gloom of Bukrai : with a 1-turn action and a successful Spirit test, the Gulmora projects a murky shadow five feet around itself. In broad daylight, the gloom averts its dissolution for one hour (CS 8 hours).

## kôrvakai

Gulmorvrin are not the only demonic servants of Morgath. Amid the ruins of ancient Irkargai in southern Azeryan are the evil spirits known as the Korvakai . Thought to be something different than Morvrin, many of these entities remain incarnate centuries after having answered the arcane summons of Morgathian priests.

Incarnated : the Gulmora's form suffers the effects of most physical trauma-bleeding, unconsciousness, impairment and shock states. Upon receiving a KIA state, the incarnated form is destroyed and the demon undergoes dissolution (page 382).

While incarnated, the Gulmora is tireless (page 379) like an Amorvrus-immune to asphyxia, starvation, thirst, sleep, and fatigue.

Language : Gulmorvrin have fluency in the Morgathian temple tongue Ormauk.

Mute the Shadow : with a 1-turn action and a successful Spirit test, the Gulmora can reduce its Shadow Strength from SHA8 to SHA4 for 1 hour (CS 8 hours). It may restore its full SHA as a free action.

Shadow Control : as a free action, the Gulmora can issue a single command to up to 16 Dalmorvrin within 80 feet. As a 1-turn action, it could issue the same or a different command to up to 16 additional Dalmorvrin on the same IR as the first group.
