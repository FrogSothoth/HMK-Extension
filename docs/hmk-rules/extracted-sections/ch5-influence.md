# Influence

## influence

The status characters attain reflects both the class into which they were born and the personal influence they ultimately wield to enhance it. All Kethiran cultures measure such impact according to a character's ability both to sway individuals on an intimate level ( persuasion ), as well as to navigate shrewdly larger networks over a longer term ( conspiracy ).

## roleplaying influence

While the following rules do not supplant the roleplaying of social interactions that arise in the game, players should keep in mind the abilities of their characters. Evocative and entertaining roleplaying reaps its own self-evident reward: games are more memorable and fun. However, players need not be punished for lacking theatrical talent. In the end, it is their characters who should be tested.

## Persuasion

The first type of influence characters can wield is called persuasion. Five specific skills-Charm, Command, Discourse, Guile, and Theatrics-are collectively deemed the persuasion skills . Each one measures a unique technique for convincing a single person or small group to do what the speaker wishes. The time frame is immediate; the effect occurs within seconds or perhaps minutes.

Each persuasion skill has its own domain and action :

Haggling : Charm (to tempt); Guile (to defraud); or Discourse (to present).

Interrogation : Charm (to confide); Command (to frighten); or Guile (to outwit).
