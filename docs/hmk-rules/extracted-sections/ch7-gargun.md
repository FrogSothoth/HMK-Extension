PRÝEH

Over six hundred years ago, a Hârnic renegade wizard-lord named Lothrim the Foulspawner created, or brought to Kethira, a violent species of people to help in his quest for an ancient treasure called the Penultimate Tome. The work was purported to contain the secrets of the Earthmasters, and the search for it led him and his Gargun to the Kuzhan city of Kiraz. Its destruction in tr 120 by the rampaging horde came to be called the Carnage of Kiraz.

Although Lothrim's forces were ultimately defeated a few months later, remnants of the Gargun army lived on. Over the centuries, the rapacious 'orcs' or 'goblins', as people came to call them, spread throughout the entire central mountain spine of Hârn, eventually appearing in the northwest of mainland Lythia.

## Physique

Gargun are warm-blooded, short humanoids that hatch from eggs. They are divided into five species, distinguished primarily by the colour of their fur.

Gargú-aráki (streaked): small, alert trackers.

Gargú-hyéka (brown): the most common type; miners.

Gargú-khánu (black): the largest, most skilled warriors. Gargú-kyáni (white): shrewd hunters and dog-trainers. Gargú-viásal (red): fierce and aggressive cannibals.

They average three to four feet in height and usually weigh between 70 and 100 pounds, also varying by species.

A single fertile female, the queen, lays up to eighty eggs a month after becoming pregnant by the one fertile male (the king). Three to six months later, the eggs hatch, with newborns becoming physically mature in a few days and fully grown inside a year. Gargun eat only meat, especially enjoying human and Kuzhan flesh (sometimes even cooked). They readily resort to cannibalism if pressed.

## Personality

HLEJIS

HURISÉA

Gargun are competitive and brutal. They fight not only among themselves, but with other tribes and all people nearby. Unscrupulous in morality and bereft of empathy, a Gargun exudes a life of conflict, one naturally not lasting three decades when it is not violently cut shorter.

However, they are not without cunning, even a certain intelligence, passed on through racial memory. Each subspecies speaks its own language, and some members learn other tongues. They exhibit specialised skills, such as crafts, animal husbandry, and herbalism. In combat Gargun usually depend on aggression and outnumbering.

## Society

An individual Gargun tribe most often consists of 500 to 2000 members of a single subspecies who live in an underground complex deep in the wilderness. When more than one species appears in the same tribe, the stronger type subjugates the weaker ones (power is not shared). Ninety-nine per cent of Gargun are male; the remaining females often form a Queen's guard, or escape or are kidnapped by a different tribe.

The unrestrained population growth of a Gargun tribe is held in check in three ways: internal purging; civil war; and, most infamously, 'swarming'. Purging usually occurs in tribes with a strong or clever king who regularly culls his followers. If leadership is challenged, the resulting civil war can expend up to 80% of the males in a swift, hours-long orgy of bloodletting. Lastly, sometimes in anticipation of a purge or resulting from a failed civil war, half the tribe will seize the females and fight their way out, swarming their way across the land in search of a new home-a deadly throng for anyone crossing its path.

## gargú-arák Small Orc

3'�" · 7� lbs  small

With streaked orange- or yellow-brown fur, the Araki are the smallest subspecies of Gargun. They form nomadic tribes of several hundred in the deep forest, dwelling in primitive huts or nests slung in trees when not in underground lodges. Araki are skilled nocturnal predators and stalkers, vigilant against being enslaved (or eaten) by larger Gargun.

Bowyer : Araki practice archery more than other goblin types, able to make crude, small self bows and arrows ( br 120 · +3 p · light shafts d6 · heavy shafts d8).

Herbalist : cunning survivalists, small orcs make exotic concoctions, typically applying a mild paralytic to their arrows. The target's END test to resist (page 75) has a net +13 bonus.

Night Vision : the streaked orc tests Awareness in dim light and shadows with no penalty. At night or in near-pitch black, when most other folk are blinded, they suffer only -20 penalty.

Scent : Araki possess an acute sense of smell, having Scent Index 1 (page 353).

## gargú-khánu Great Orc

4'�" · 1�5 lbs  small

The dark-furred Gargu-khanu are the largest, strongest, and most violent species of orc. Because they breed much more slowly, great orcs force Arak or Hyeka slaves to do the work and crafting in their cave lodges. Even more than other Gargun, the Khani elite rule in a strict hierarchy, with murder and assassination being the primary means of advancing.

Aggressive : an especially murderous nature compels a Khanu defender always to choose the Counterstrike option.

Domineering : black orcs bully and intimidate each other and their enslaved subjects. re in

Warrior : the Gargu-Khanu are nearly a match against larger folk in combat. They possess skill in Archery (although they rarely employ bows), Throwing, and Climbing. They routinely don scale byrnies and small shields (WQ 9, Shield Mod 10, Deflect 3), and possess enough strength to wield effectively the cleaverlike Mang one-handed.

## gargú-hyéka Brown Orc

3'11" · 98 lbs  small

About half of the total Gargun population, Hyeki are often called 'common orcs'. Some live in woodland lodges like the Araki, but they usually fashion cavecomplexes in or near the mountains. They routinely send out bands of 20-80 foragers and keep large animal stocks as food and for work. With an even higher rate of birth than other species, the Gargu-hyeka are more likely to swarm.

Aggressive : an especially aggressive nature and a strong sense of territory lead a Hyeka defender always to choose the Counterstrike option.

Miner : notable tunnellers, brown orcs have skill in Animalcraft, Metalcraft, and Mineralogy. They are known to fashion blind ways, pits, and traps throughout their cave complexes.

Weaponcraft : although they do not often wear it, brown orcs craft passable scale and even some mail armour. They also fashion Mangs and Mankars, trading them with other tribes or losing them to raids and enslavement.

## gargú-kyáni White Orc

3'1�" · 96 lbs  small

With dark blonde, grey, or white fur, the Gargu-kyani are the second-smallest orcs. They live in colder regions, often where ground snow is year-round. Kyani raise and train wolves and dogs as pets and to assist them in hunting. They sometimes exhibit the peaceful and sociable mores of 'civilised' folk, possessing a vague sense of tribal and personal honour. While Kyani are the least violent orc subspecies, they also value courage and have been known to kill captives who surrender too readily.

Animal Trainer : Kyani train wolves more often than their expensive hunting dogs.

Crafter : white orcs produce passable arms and armour but are more known for their silversmithing.

## gargú-viásal Red Orc

4' · 1�� lbs  small

The auburn- to red-furred Gargu-viasal have small communities and swarm less often than the Hyeka. They are the most cannibalistic subspecies and many work themselves into a frenzy before battle by gorging on slaves or weaker tribe members. They have a violent, adversarial relation to black orcs; confrontations between the two often lead to complete mutual destruction.

Aggressive : an especial recklessness leads a Viasal defender always to choose the Counterstrike option.

Domineering : Gargu-viasal bully and intimidate each other and their enslaved subjects.

Relentless : Once engaged, red orcs receive +20 bonus to Morale tests.

Warrior : the Viasal are second only to the Khanu in combat. They possess skill in Archery (although they rarely employ bows), Throwing, and Climbing. They wear scale byrnies but prefer wielding handaxes two-handed, and so do not carry shields.
