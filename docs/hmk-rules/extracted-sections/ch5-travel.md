# Travel

## travel

Adventures usually take characters somewhere. Common journeys follow roads connecting settlements or involve cross-country hikes through forests and mountains. Trips of any great distance can demand an oft-perilous sea voyage. The strangest travels are likely the rare esoteric ones, such as spirit trips or Godstone transport.

The following section explains the rules for three types of journeys: trekking, sea voyages, and dimensional travel.

## roleplaying travel

Gamemasters and players may wish to narrate travel without recourse to specific game mechanics. They may even waive it entirely, the way movies quickly cut out matter seen as extraneous to more important plot elements. However, making certain tests at timely moments more fairly highlights precious nature skills. Even following travel routines in detail does not obviate evocative description and roleplaying along the way.

## Trekking

Embarking on an overland journey is called trekking . A trek consists of five elements, identified at the outset.

Party : the people making the trek.

Route : the intended course to the destination, if known. Pure exploration with no planned route is also possible.

Conveyance : the means of overland travel-either foot, mount, cart, or wagon. One party might utilise several different means, but progress is measured by the slowest.

Guide : the single character designated as the primary navigator and pathfinder, usually the one with the highest Survival ML. Others may assist (page 60).

Drover : the character selected as the primary beast wrangler, either simultaneously the guide or someone else. Conveyance by horse tests the drover's Riding; by cart or wagon, Animalcraft. Leading pack animals is considered foot conveyance that tests Animalcraft. With mixedconveyance, use the lower of either skill. Others with the corresponding skill may assist.

## trekking routine

When a party begins the journey, use the Trekking Routine to help describe its events. Movement is measured in one-league units (4 kilometres or about 2.5 miles). Atlas Keléstia PDF maps include a one-league hex layer, so a unit of distance in the routine is also called a hex.

Scale: the nine steps of the Trekking Routine equal four hours, also called a watch . One unit of movement covers one league (four kilometres).
