## Lore

Lore skills reflect mundane knowledge. While Craft, Nature, and Esoteric skills also require erudition, the various Lore skills specifically measure the grasp of Kethiran technology, history, and culture. Aside from Cookery, Folklore, one Ritual skill, and Physician, Lore skills require training.

## Social

These skills measure how well one influences other people. Largely based upon eloquence, they also feature perceptive powers, creativity, and physical beauty. Apart from foreign languages, characters may test Social skills without training.

## Nature

Nature Group skills measure wilderness lore. They usually demand keen senses, wit, or raw determination. Outdoor knowledge is hard-earned-the untrained character may intuitively attempt only the simplest of survival tasks.

## Physical

While Physical Attributes describe a character's innate physique, Physical Group skills test actions related to the body or senses. Physical skills usually do not require training, except for highly specialised feats like Acrobatics and Legerdemain.

## Combat

Fighting includes raw attributes and skills from other groups-Strength, Command-but Combat skills measure effective action amid the chaos of battle. Everyone can muster some ability to defend themselves; true prowess requires training.

## Craft

Skills that produce mundane technologies, items, or effects belong to the Craft Group. Something is made in the world: jewellery, a weapon, music. Craft skills rely on the senses and dexterity or even strength, and almost always requires training.

## Esoterica

The skills that deal with the arcane or astral mysteries comprise the Esoterica group. They do not receive Sunsign Modifiers like those of the six mundane skill groups. Instead, a character's birth sunsign influences each esoteric skill uniquely and more directly. While briefly described in the skill entries, esoteric skills receive full explanation in their respective section of Chapter 6: The Mysteries.
