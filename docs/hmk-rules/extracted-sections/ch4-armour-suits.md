# Armour Suits

## Armour Suits

For ease of immediate gameplay, the following section details twelve armour suits. These offer a variety sufficient enough to describe the clothing and armour worn by most folk, from the simple outfit of a peasant to the imposing mail armour of nobility. Players may customise the twelve suits-or fabricate entirely unique ones piece by pieceby consulting the tables and rules in the Armour Articles section (page 117).

Each suit of armour is given a name usually according to its most prominent article. Consult the Armour Suits Entries box, below, for an explanation of essential terms. See the Weaponcraft skill (page 89) for rules on how to fabricate clothing and armour.

## encumbrance

Armour is less restricting than many imagine. Warriors retain some coordination even in the heaviest pieces. Encumbrance (ENC) affects characters in two ways:

- Move, Agility, and skills with Agility in the Skill Base suffer a penalty equal to ENC. Strength then modifies these amounts (see box, below right). Tests of swimming involve harsher ENC penalties (page 86).

## Strike Zones &amp; Locations

For the purposes of armour protection and injury, a human-like body consists of four general zones , divided further into 15 specific locations . Armour Value equals the total av of all layers of material present at each location.

| Head   | Skull      | Sk     |
|        | Face       | Fa     |

|        | Calf       | Ca     |
|        | Foot       | Ft     |

- Modified ENC +  5 equals the character's Personal Fatigue (PF), the amount of fatigue accumulated over a given period of exertion (page 176).

Some creatures present unique locations according to their body type, such as wings, tails, and additional legs-see Chapter 7: Bestiary .

## a encumbrance strength modifier

Strength	(STR)	can	affect	a	character's	Encumbrance	(ENC). A	STR	of	at	least	12	reduces	ENC	by	the	amount	given below,	down	to	a	minimum	ENC	0.	A	STR	of	less	than	10 increases	ENC,	but	only	when	the	base	ENC	is	at	least	5.

| str   | mod   | Example1 : a characterwithENC15and   |
|-------|-------|--------------------------------------|
| 5     | (+15) | STR12hasmodifiedENC10(15-5=10),      |
| 6-7   | (+10) | and,thus,Personal Fatigue 15.        |
| 8-9   | (+5)  | Example2 : a characterwithENC15      |
| 10-11 | 0     | andSTR18hasmodifiedENC0              |
| 12-13 | -5    | (15-20=minimum0)andPF5.              |
| 14-15 | -10   | Example3 : a characterwithENC5and    |
| 16-17 | -15   | STR8hasmodifiedENC10(5+5=10)         |
| 18-19 | -20   | andPF15.WithabaseENC0,thesame        |
| 20-21 | -25   | character wouldinstead have modified |
| …     | …     | ENC0andPF5.                          |

Being mounted improves	the	character's	ENC	modifier	from Strength	by	15.	For	instance,	-5	improves	to	-20.

Bulk penalty (page	117)	arises	from	the	excessive	layering	of clothing	and	armour,	but	applies	independently	of	ENC.

## clothing

|   price |   enc |   per | area   |   lb |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|------|

The basic article of clothing for folk throughout most of Venârivè	is	the	tunic,	its	sleeves	varying	in	length	from above the elbow down to the wrists. Layered with vests or robes and combined with leggings, trousers, shoes, or swaddling,	the	Clothing	suit	offers	some	protection	against the elements, if very little versus weapons.

Clothing material varies according to social class. Shown here is the heavy coarse cloth typical of the low to middle classes	(Wealth 6).	As	a	guide,	multiply	the	100d	cost proportionally	to	Wealth	to	reflect	the	greater	use	of	linen, fine	wool,	soft	leather,	and	silk	in	the	garments	of	the	higher classes.	Thus,	guilded	folk	(Wealth 12)	likely	spend	200d	on their attire; the lavish clothing of a powerful baron might cost	1200d	(Wealth	72)	to	1500d		(Wealth 90)	or	more.

## heavy clothing

|   price |   enc |   per | area   |   lb |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|------|

In colder climates folk usually just wear more layers or include	heftier	wool	tunics.	Depicted	here	is	a	suit	of	Heavy Clothing consisting of cloth underlayers of a long-sleeved tunic and coat, topped somewhat unusually by a padded shirt. This is commonly worn as backing to a mail byrnie; alone, it might give a poor member of the militia a sense of wearing true 'armour'. Tribal people in many parts of Venarive mimic such upper body protection by way of animal skin	mantles.	The	stiff	leather	helm	sewn	over	a	cloth arming cap mitigates some weapon impact and is nearly as rigid	as	the	uppers	of	the	illustrated	shoes.	However,	the	cap is more likely donned for protection against the elements.

The	cost	of	Heavy	Clothing	reflects	class	like	Clothing; modify its cost to get the desired apparent Wealth.

## quilted coat

|   price |   enc |   per | area   |   lb |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|------|
|     400 |     5 |     0 | f4     |   20 |

Suits	more	substantial	than	Heavy	Clothing	can	be considered true armour, at least socially speaking, if not to	the	same	effective	extent.	While	the	half	dozen	or	so textile layers of the bulky Quilt Coat might also serve as an expensive heavy winter jacket, the hardened leather kurbul	helmet	definitely	marks	the	suit's	wearer	as	some type of martialist: a yeoman archer, a veteran of the town militia, or perhaps a successful brigand. Those not requiring as much mobility might augment the depicted suit with kurbul spot protection on the arms and legs.

For the Quilted Coat and the nine more substantial suits that follow, the Wealth multiplier rule does not usually apply.	Someone	donning	such	suits	already	reflects	a	specific class-the warrior class.

## kûrbúl cuirass

|   price |   enc |   per | area   |   lb |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|------|

Some have mistakenly translated the Azeryani word kurbul as 'boiled' or even 'waxed' leather-however, armourers use a process to create the rigid leather-plate that involves merely hot water. What results, in any event, is a rigid armour about five	times	as	thick	as	and	of	equal	weight	with	metal	plate, albeit much cheaper to make. Kurbul is used in helms and breastplates and in limb pieces, although a little thinner in	the	latter	case.	While	hard,	the	stuff	can	be	brittle	(see optional breakage rules, page 133).

Likely only a professional soldier would don the suit pictured-a	city	guard	or	mercenary.	Weaponcrafters	can make a version of kurbul that is twice as thick as usual, but some	baulk	at	the	cost	and	weight	(+200d,	+10 enc , +15 lb ), despite	the	increased	protection	(+2 av to all sh · ua · tx · ab ).

## scale byrnie

|   price |   enc |   per | area   |   lb |

The individual scales of a Scale Byrnie suit are a third the thickness of plate armour and vary in width from about a quarter of an inch to two inches-those depicted here are in the middle of this range. Their tips could be pointed or rounded.	Backed	with	leather,	scale	armour	is	stiffer	and less durable than mail and more cumbersome than plate, but quicker to produce than mail and cheaper than plate.

The suit shown would belong to a professional warrior and	would	fill	a	niche	similar	to	the	Gambeson	and	Kurbul Cuirass suits. The plate helm here is a 'kettle' helm, its brim deflecting	downward	plunging	missiles	better.	If	the	Face Location option rule (page 133) is used, the kettle helm provides Plate coverage ( b 6e 11p 9) to the eyes and ears against arrows and bolt volley shots (page 164).

## mail byrnie

|   price |   enc |   per | area   |   lb |

The	flexibility	of	mail	allows	it	to	be	fashioned	into	articles that cover the entire body-an advantage unmatched by leather and other metal armours. It is also quite durable and fairly easy to maintain. Warriors of modest skill can repair individual links on their own. A padded shirt or tunic is	worn	beneath	mail,	often	sewn	integrally	into	it.

The Mail Byrnie shown here covers most of the vulnerable areas of the torso. The plate helm with arming cap prevents nearly all serious blows to the skull; its subtended	piece	deflects	strikes	to	the	nose.	With	practically no other substantial protection, the Mail Byrnie is intended for maximum mobility and extended wear, perhaps donned by a marine, viking raider, or travelling or hunting noble.

## gambeson

|   price |   enc |   per | area   |   lb |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|------|
|     800 |    10 |     0 | f5     |   30 |

An extremely rigid textile armour made from up to two dozen layers of stitched cloth, the Gambeson suit reduces quite	effectively	the	impact	of	most	weapons.	While	not cheaply made, its design is such that even clothiers can fashion it. The arms of the coat are attached separately to the torso and must be made thinner to allow for movement.	Even	this	would	be	too	stiff	for	leggings,	and	so gambeson material is limited to arm and torso armour. It is surprisingly	heavy-more	so	when	soaked	(+10 enc; 50 lb ).

The suit depicted includes a substantial padded arming cap and plate helm, as well as stout boots and kurbul knee protection. This armour would denote a warrior of some professionalism, such as a lord's household man-at-arms, a squire, or perhaps even a young or poor knight bachelor.

## scale habergeon

|   price |   enc |   per | area   |   lb |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|------|
|     950 |    15 |     5 | f6     |   40 |

Scale	shares	some	of	the	flexibility	of	mail	and	so	can	be fashioned similarly to cover much of the same areas of the upper	body.	However,	its	stiffness	effectively	prevents	its	use in full sleeves or in leggings.

The	Scale	Habergeon	shown	here	extends	over	the elbows and over the pelvis. It would appear worn by a heavy footman, a trained soldier equipped for a crowded melee. While the masked plate helm slightly impairs visionand the addition of kurbul arm protection exacerbates long-term fatigue during a hand-to-hand battle-this suit would allow for a fair amount of mobility, while still covering nearly all vulnerable areas. While it is only about £1	cheaper	than	Mail	Habergeon,	such	a	saving	becomes significant	when	a	lord	outfits	entire	companies.

## mail habergeon

|   price |   enc |   per | area   |   lb |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|------|
|    1100 |    10 |     0 | f5     |   30 |

Essentially a slightly enhanced version of the Mail Byrnie, the	Mail	Habergeon	lengthens	the	mail	shirt	in	the	arms and below the waist. Similarly, the byrnie's shorter padded under-tunic now becomes a full-length coat. While in general armour is less encumbering than one might imagine, any loss of mobility or increase in long-term exertion mostly stems from the burden of arm and leg pieces-the torso much more readily bears such strain. The suit here provides stouter protection to the lower body at just such an expense in encumbrance.

A wealthy yeoman footman or man-at-arms on campaign	would	wear	a	Mail	Habergeon,	likely	one	of	the most commonly seen suits among soldiers in feudal realms.

## mail hauberk

The	Mail	Hauberk	suit	demonstrates	the	zenith	of	its material's advantage-head-to-toe protection against nearly all lethal melee weapon strikes. The mail mittens shown here are separate articles sewn into the shirt's sleeve. Often	they	are	an	extended	part	of	the	mail	itself	with	a slitted leather palm that allows the hand to slip out when needed. The mail leggings have a leather bottom under the feet to give better traction. The padded and mail cowls muffle	hearing	and	obstruct	some	peripheral	vision.

For	the	most	part,	only	the	nobility	can	afford	the enormous expense of a full suit of mail. While a Mail Hauberk	suit	is	worn	primarily	by	the	knights	and	their retinue of heavy cavalry, its encumbrance is not so great as to prevent some mobility in unmounted combat.

Kurbul serves as a cheaper, if more temporary, substitute for plate armour. In its optional thicker version, the suite encumbers and weighs more than plate, but only protects nearly as well (use the same adjustments as given for the option explained in the Kurbul Cuirass entry, page 114).

Usually only mounted warriors wear the Kurbul &amp; Mail suit shown here-as evidenced mostly by the plate greaves on the legs. Whether a wealthy manor lord or an elite royal man-at-arms,	the	fighter	would	be	quite	encumbered dismounted. More importantly, the suit would prove too exhausting to bear for long on foot in a pitched battle. The face-plated helm atop the padded and mail cowls also inhibits perception, a disadvantage less important while mounted.

For the same area of coverage, plate actually weighs less than mail and even the textile gambeson. While its expense keeps it rare, and thus underdeveloped throughout most realms of Venarive, it technically could eventually prove easier to manufacture than mail. Moreover, blunt trauma does not transfer through plate, unlike mail-only denting and driving it against bone threatens its wearer.

Aside from the Kuzhai superheavy foot companies, only mounted warriors would wear Plate &amp; Mail. Like Kurbul &amp; Plate, this armour makes even short-term melee and movement quickly tiring, and its fully encompassing great helm largely impedes vision and hearing. It is a suit likely afforded by only the wealthiest nobility, such as a preeminent manor lord or tenant-in-chief.
