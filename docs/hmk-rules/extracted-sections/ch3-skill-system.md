# Skill System

## skill system

The breadth and depth of the ability to do things in the world is measured in large part by the skills characters develop. While social class and raw talent might create limitations, characters may theoretically acquire any skill during either the initial generation or the unfolding campaign. They may focus on improving a narrow range of skills within a specific pursuit or instead choose to acquire a wider range across disparate vocations.

## skill group

All skills belong to one of seven Skill Groups-six mundane (Combat, Craft, Lore, Nature, Physical, Social) and one special (Esoterica). Each mundane Skill Group carries a sunsign modifier between -15 and +15, as determined during character generation.

Sunsign modifiers affect the Fate Roll ML of mundane skills (page 276). While skills of the Esoterica group never receive the benefit of Fate Rolls, the character's sunsign does affect various arcane tasks, such as spellcasting, astromantic readings, and the preparation of magic elixirs, as explained in Chapter 6: The Mysteries .

## mastery level

Mastery Level (ML) measures a character's ability in an attribute or skill. It is rated between 0 and 100 (or higher).

Maximum Mastery : the maximum ML characters may attain in a skill equals seven times its Skill Base (SB × 7).

## star rating

Professional competence is often expressed on a 0-5 star scale. Many publications already list the ratings of NPCs, but they may also be determined randomly:

| d100   | star rating   | ml    | randomml   | competence   |
|--------|---------------|-------|------------|--------------|
| 01-10  | zero          | ≤ 49  | 1d20+29    | Inept        |
| 11-30  |              | 50-59 | 1d10+49    | Novice       |
| 31-60  |             | 60-69 | 1d10+59    | Aspirant     |
| 61-85  |            | 70-79 | 1d10+69    | Professional |
| 86-95  |           | 80-89 | 1d10+79    | Expert       |
| 96-00  |          | 90+   | 1d10+89    | Paragon      |

## index

The Index of a Mastery Level equals one tenth its ML (rounded down). Index is used in several rules, most prominently in Success Value tests (page 61) and applications of Secondary Mastery (page 62).

Examples : Mastery Level 87 has an Index of 8; ML25 has Index 2; and ML102 has Index  10.

## success test

Actions taken by a character that involve uncertainty require a Success test. Often noted simply as a 'test', it resolves a discrete endeavour that is completed quicklysuch as striking a foe, casting a spell, or recalling lore.

## success level

To make a test, roll d100. A result less than or equal to ML is a success; a result greater is a failure. A roll where the units (second) number is a 5 or 0 is a critical. Thus, a roll of 73 against ML70 is a failure; but a roll of 75 is a critical failure. This gives four possible success levels:

## success levels

- cf critical failure : task	fails	very	badly.
- f failure : task	fails.
- s success : task	succeeds.
- cs critical success : task	succeeds	especially	well.

Split CF : sometimes the same Critical Failure indicates two different results-one when the die roll ends in a zero (CF 0) and one when the die roll ends in a five (CF 5).

F/S : some tests measure just failure (CF/F) or success (S/ CS). Combat Mishaps (page 161 sidebar) are an example.

## effective mastery level

Bonuses or penalties can modify the chance of a test. After accounting for all adjustments, the result is called the Effective Mastery Level (EML). Regardless of actual modifiers, most tests have a minimum EML05 and a maximum EML 95. This allows for some chance of failure and success-the rules will note the exceptions. The GM can also deem certain tests in extreme situations as automatically failing or succeeding, even critically so.

Assistance : characters making a test can receive assistance from others who have at least half the ML of the tester .

- Assistants contribute a bonus equal to their own Index to the tester's EML.
- A tester can receive no more than a total +10 bonus from assistance, no matter how many assistants.
- There might be a physical limit to how many assistants can help (for instance one or two during surgery).
- Some tasks might not plausibly allow for assistance (physically helping someone shoot a bow).

Example : a character with Tracking ML72 makes a test. Two others with Tracking ML43 and ML16 offer assistance. The first lends a +4 bonus to the test (now EML76). The second cannot effectively help because ML16 is less than half the tester's ML72.
