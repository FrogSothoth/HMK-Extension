was told the ring would be in the small wooden box sitting on the table next to Lady Alawyn's bed. With the sun dropping close to the western ridge, the hallway in the keep outside her bedroom is already quite dark. I stand to the side of the door, clutching three thick candles, waiting to place them inside for the maid to light soon. This only gives me several minutes.

Lady Alawyn and her cousin come out of the room, her darting eyes registering the candles. 'It's quite frightful-I don't think she made it out of Waleden in time,' she remarks as they turn and stride slowly down the hall. Gowns had lengthened over the past few years to drag now across the floor, and the two had perfected the slow and awkward stride needed to raise the embroidered hems slightly with their feet and knees to avoid tripping. To do so with the grace of appearing not to try requires practice.

I wait respectfully until they descend, one careful step at a time, the stairs at the end of the hallway. I then enter the bedchamber, its door left open, and go to the box on the side table. The lid displays a stag head inlay-this is the one-so I open it. As if forgotten, the black onyx ring lies buried under a mound of broaches and chains. As I grab the ring, I'm immediately startled by the clap of cantering hooves striking the stone courtyard outside. Hurrying over to the narrow aperture, I see down below a half dozen armoured men-at-arms in yellow surcoats, their horses spent from a hard ride. Several have already dismounted and are rushing the front door.

It's time for me to leave.

## weights

These are common measures of weight, and liquid and dry volume.

| weight        | 16 drams = 1 ounce 16ounces=1pound 100 pounds = 1 hundredweight 2000pounds=1ton             |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| liquid volume | 20fluid ounces = 1 pint 2 pints = 1 quart 4 quarts = 1 gallon 50 gallons = 1 hogshead       |
| dry volume    | 16 dry pints = 1 peck 4 pecks = 1 bushel 8 bushels = 1 quarter 4 quarters = 1 tun (burthen) |

## measures

These are common linear and area measures.

| linear   | 12 inches = 1 foot 3 feet = 1 yard 22 yards = 1 chain 10 chains = 1 furlong 20furlongs = 1 league ( 1 league = ~4 kmor~2.5miles)   |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| area     | 4840 square yards = 1 acre 30 acres = 1 yardland or virgate 120 acres = 1 hide 4000acres = 1 estate                                |

## time

Candle clocks are cut to a size and burning time for specific applications. Hourglasses and sundials also exist, with water clocks used mainly in southeastern Venarive.

| 12 short breaths=1min.   | 6 watches = 1 day   |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| 60minutes = 1 hour       | 30days=1month       |
| 4 hours = 1 watch        | 12 months=1year     |

## coins

The most common unit of currency in most of Venarive is the silver penny, abbreviated with a 'd' following the amount. The standard of 240 pennies to the pound (£) derives from the first pennies minted by the Azeryani Empire, where 240 pennies equalled one gold majis . A penny weighs one dram (one sixteenth of an ounce), although purity varies in reality. Pennies may be cut in two to make a halfpenny (each worth 2 farthings, 2f) or into four parts (1f each). Twelve pennies (12d) are often called a shilling, and 240d, a pound. Neither are usually actual coins but rather just accounting conventions.

## introduction

## Feudal Arms &amp; Armour

Feudal societies generally restrict who may bear what kind of weapons and armour according to their social class. The punishment for violating these norms can vary by realm. For instance, any corrective issued in the Kingdom of Rethem will likely be quite draconian compared to a more measured rebuke in Emelrene. Exemptions are also not uncommonfeudal lords often extend the right to bear chivalric weapons and armour to non-noble retainers under their banner.

Common : unfree peasantry may carry the tools used in their crafts, and heavy clothing serves as their 'armour'. Their lords can grant allowance to bear simple arms for militia training and in times of invasion.

Arms : club, falcastra, grainflail, hand sling, hatchet, knife, maul (wooden head), pickaxe, pitchfork, sickle, staff, stick, wood axe, whip.

Armour Suits : clothing, heavy clothing.

Simple : freeman are usually allowed modest arms and armour; militia and soldiers are routinely issued more substantial weapons. They usually wear textile armours and often wield roundshields.

Arms : buckler, composite bow, composite crossbow, dagger, glaive, javelin, keltan, longbow, longknife, mang, mankar, maul (metal head), morningstar, net, pike, shorkana, scimitar, roundshield, shortsword, spear, staff sling, taburi, tower shield, trident, warflail, whip (Reksyni), wooden crossbow.

Armour Suits : quilt coat, kurbul cuirass, gambeson.

Chivalric : the gentry bear the most lethal and highly restricted weapons. They wear expensive mail, scale, and plate armours. This does not keep them from using 'lesser' weapons-such as the spear-but chivalric weapons are powerful status symbols.

Arms : ball &amp; chain, bastard sword, battleaxe, battlesword, broadsword, estoc, falchion, handaxe, jousting pole, lance, mace, poleaxe, shield (kite, knight's), warhammer.

Armour Suits : scale byrnie, mail byrnie, scale habergeon, mail habergeon, mail hauberk, kurbul &amp; mail, plate &amp; mail.
