# Weapons

## weapons

Characters may equip themselves with weapons for handto-hand fighting, throwing, and projecting missiles. Despite having a variety of traits, all weapons share two important characteristicsstrike aspect and strike impact .

## Strike Aspect

Weapons are rated according to the kind of damage they inflict. This strike aspect can be one of four types:

Blunt [ b ] : crushing, bludgeoning, and squeezing trauma.

Edge [ e ] : tears, chops, cuts, and slashing wounds.

Point [ p ] : punctures and impalements.

Fire/Frost [ f ] : burn and cold injuries.

Characters may wield melee weapons in different ways to deliver varying strike aspects-see Strike Mode, below.

## Strike Impact

Weapons are rated according to how much damage they deliver. This strike impact is measured by the roll of an impact die plus an impact modifier:

Impact Die : each weapon is assigned a polyhedral die between d4 and d12 that is rolled to generate a random amount of impact with each successful strike.

Impact Modifiers : after rolling the impact die, the strike impact is modified from three primary sources.

Weapon : an innate weapon modifier can be positive, zero, or negative. Weapon quality and enchantments, such as the spell Anvil (Jmorvi III), can increase this amount.

Strength : the wielder's Strength attribute can further affect impact. With melee and thrown weapons, the Strength Impact Modifier table below determines the strength modifier. With bows and crossbows , the draw characteristic (page �0�) produces the modifier, adjusted by range to the target. The sum of the Impact Die and the Weapon and Strength Modifiers is called base impact.

Impact TA : attacks augmented with an Impact Tactical Advantage (page 171) increase base impact according to the weapon's strike aspect: usually 3 b , 5 e , 4 p , 2 f .

## character handedness

Players may select the handedness of their characters or roll for it randomly in Appendix III (page 427). Gear or weapons carried by their favoured side is said to be prime-handed ; anything on the other side is off-handed . Both sides are favoured for the rare ambidextrous folk.

## Melee Weapons

Melee weapons belong to one of eight weapon groups. While characters test Melee skill no matter the melee weapon, each group has characteristics which either modify the test directly or otherwise highlight the weapon's unique features.

Axes : their heavy, sharp blades deliver a focused impact but also make them cumbersome to redirect defensively.

Clubs : the large impact surface of clubs makes it easier to land connecting strikes, despite the weight.

Flails : their hinged nature makes flails harder to redirect quickly but more unpredictable for targets to avoid.

Knives : compact point-weapons used in close quarters; some knives are specialised for defence or throwing.

Polearms : a variety of weapons with great reach, wielded most effectively by many warriors in ranked formation.

Shields : the essential pieces of defence carried universally across nearly all battlefields of Venarive; frequently selected even before a helm.

Swords : their long, sharp edges give swords a lethal accuracy, especially against lightly armoured targets.

: biting, clawing, punching, and wrestling-the

Unarmed natural weapons of people and beasts.

## Strike Mode

Melee weapons can be wielded in a variety of ways, each called a Strike Mode. One can swing a sword's edge, thrust with its point, or even hammer with its blunt pommel. The entries starting on page 99 describe each melee weapon's primary Strike Mode as well as popular alternatives.

## Strength Impact Modifier

As mentioned above, the modifier to melee weapon impact varies according to the combatant's Strength score:
