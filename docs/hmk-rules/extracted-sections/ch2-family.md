## Family

The next phase of generation determines how family upbringing impacts a character's development. Such influence is measured by way of four characteristics: Parent Class, Parent Occupation, Background, and Estrangement. The character's native Society, as previously revealed in the Region table of the place of birth (step 5), greatly affects these four elements of Family.

## Society

The human realms of Venarive consist of four broad society types. Each exhibits enough subtle variation to engender its own subtype.

Feudal : the most prevalent society in Venarive, a Feudal realm is very hierarchical, with a sovereign usually holding all the land. Such a king or queen then grants portions of it-called fiefs-to vassals, most of whom themselves repeat the process with even smaller land awards (called subinfeudation).

Feudal/Imperial subtype: a state, such as the Republic of Tharda on Hârn, in transition from a Feudal to an Imperial society, expressing elements of both.

Imperial : imperial societies favour centralised, bureaucratic governments and sometimes encompass large areas.

City-State subtype: a nascent Imperial society with a larger urban population and more oriented towards merchants and trade.

Tribal : the most ancient form still existing in Venarive, clan-based Tribal societies practice nomadic hunting and gathering or pastoralism, usually led by a chieftain. Settled subtype: a semi-nomadic Tribal society that has begun to adopt certain elements of sedentism.

Tributary : as an extension of Tribal societies, a Tributary one is still clan-based, but there is greater hierarchy under the rule of a specific clan or group.

Viking subtype: a seafaring Tributary society, such as those found in Ivinia, whose reach has been extended in recent centuries through travel, trade, and raiding.

## elder folk societies

Although most have elements in common with one of the four human types, each Elder Folk expresses its own unique society.

Kúzhan : Dwarven society shares the hierarchy of feudal societies, but without the unfree classes, and includes a greater emphasis on trade and guild crafts.

## nolóra: social class

As determined in step 5, Nolora belongs to the Emhle, a Tribal society within the Kingdom of Emelrene. The sidebar on page 29 reveals that one in six Emhle clans exhibit the Tribal (Settled) subtype of society. However, the Emhle of Emelrene are all the traditional Tribal type who practice the foraging method of subsistence.

Nolora's player determines her parents' Social Class on the first subtable listed in the Tribal Class &amp; Occupation section (page 29). She decides to use the more favourable d20. A roll of 10 places her parents in the Free social class, quite typical of a tribal member.

## parent occupation

As explained on page 26, players next determine their character's Parent Occupation. Nolora's player finds the Free subtable in the Occupation section and rolls d100 under the Foraging subsistence method. An 89 generates Hunter as her parents' occupation.

Sináin : Elven folk have a tribal-feudal hybrid society comprised entirely of free people ruled by a wise council and king (what passes for 'nobility' in their culture).

Although named after the Ælrhin of Evael, the Sinain society is also used to describe the Hwætharwyn.

Players of Ænarin (halfelf) characters may choose either the human-generated society or Sinain society.

## Malákta and Nâdi :

for information and data about Malakta and Nadi society, refer to their Region tables in Appendix I (page 423).

## Social Class

Every society to varying degrees consists of a hierarchy of social classes within which belong a variety of occupations. Players randomly determine both the class and occupation of their character's parents .

## Class &amp; Occupation

A Class &amp; Occupation table exists for each society, starting on page 27. Refer to the one corresponding to the character's society, as shown on the Region table of their Birthplace. A d100 roll on the first subtable generates the Class of the character's parents based purely on the demographics of the society. Thus, in a Feudal state, most of the population are Unfree (serfs or slaves). However, players have the option of rolling a more favourable d20 on the adjacent column. This die result bypasses the prospect of having unfree parents, while also increasing the chance of belonging to the higher classes.

Societies consist of some or all of the following social classes, in increasing order of prestige and power:

Unfree : the person is either a slave (slavery exists in several cultures throughout Kethira) or, in Feudal states, a serf (someone bound to a lord's land). Neither are allowed to leave their service freely.

Free : such characters may come and go as they please, whether as rural freeholding farmers or labourers, tribal members, or townspeople.

Guilded : the Guilded class is a group of free crafters who have banded together to control the training and economics in a particular trade or profession. Such guilds in Venarive are under the collective aegis of what is called the Mangai , an international organisation that fosters the prosperity and rights of all the various guilds.

Military : the free people of the Military class receive regard in most societies, the result of their specialised and potent training as warriors, men-at-arms, and archers.

Priestly : the highly prestigious Priestly class includes not only the various ranks of ordained clergy, but also, in an Imperial society, those who hold the myriad offices of its bureaucracy.

Noble : the most powerful and wealthy class of any society includes the lords of feudal realms, the patricians of oligarchies and empires, and the chiefs and clanheads of tribal and tributary societies.

## Roll	d100	for	parental	Occupation.

To determine the Occupation of the character's parents, the player rolls d100 on the ensuing subtable that corresponds to the parent's social Class. Characters do not have to pursue the same occupation as their family, but they will gain a slight skill development advantage for doing so (step 12).

The format of the Class &amp; Occupation tables is further explained in the highlighted bar, below. Make special note of the choice players have between rolling d20 and d100 to generate the class of the character's parents.
