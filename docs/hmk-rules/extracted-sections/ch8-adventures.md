# Adventures

## encounters tables

The Encounter Tables starting on the next page are referenced during the Trekking (page 150) and Seafaring Routines (page 151). GMs can also use them for inspiration when planning events and designing adventures.

Urban Environ : the Urban table is used for settlements with a Market size of 1 or more; manorial villages are considered Rural.

Lawful/Lawless : in areas involving civil unrest (riots), war or raids, or major brigandage or a crime wave, use the lawless versions of the day and night columns; in all other instances, refer to the lawful columns.

Safe Environ : PCs who are well-shelteredsuch as at home or at an inn or keep-are in a Safe Environ. Once per 24 hours during the day, the GM makes a d10 roll against TN1 for an Encounter, as explained in the Trekking Routine (page 149). If one is indicated, refer to the Encounter table suitable to the surrounding area-such as Urban, Rural, or Wilderness (even a secure cave could be considered a Safe Environ).

## typical belongings

The wealth of most non-player characters is expressed in the clothing they wear, and, for soldiers, in the arms and armour they bear. As explained in the Clothing and Heavy Clothing entries (page 113), the value of garments increases greatly with the Wealth score.

Coins : as a quick guide to how many silver pennies (d) people might carry, the GM may roll three Wealth Dice corresponding to their occupation (pages 42-44) and multiply the resulting sum by one (Unfree or Free), two (Guilded or Priestly), or five (Military or Noble).

## downtime

A period of time often passes between adventures when the PCs, most often in a Safe Environ, are not facing potential threats or challenges. During such moments of downtime , the GM may accelerate the passage of time by days, weeks, or even months. This enables PCs to engage in a variety of long-term endeavours:

-  Treating and recovering from injuries.
-  Undertaking spell research.
-  Creating arcane artefacts.
-  Reading or creating written works.
-  Performing and attending ceremonies.
-  Crafting items and building structures.
-  Developing skills.
-  Training animals.
-  Working, and generating income.

## Adventures

Short games might involve only a single adventure, while longer campaigns consist of a series of them. In either case, when designing an adventure, GMs should consider the following elements:

[�] Adversary : who is the PC's central foe or pressing motivation? If the adventure is part of a larger campaign, is this adversary the same as the campaign's antagonist, or is it a henchmen or ally? Or unrelated? Or not even a person or creature ( rescuing missing miners from a cave complex )?

[�] Outcome : describe to yourself the sequence of events that would happen were the PCs not involved, and what the consequences would be ( the miners die, and the Nolah begins to lure more villagers ). By contrast, how might the PC's success affect a larger, unfolding campaign?

Indeterminacy : GMs should refrain from scripting and expecting a specific outcome. Try to allow the PC's decisions and random rolls determine the adventure's ending. PCs may fail, even die.

[�] Challenges : make a list of the ways the adversary could challenge the PCs ( trekking to the cave , facing the Nolah in the cave , saving the lost miners ). The GM designs each such challenge as its own encounter (below).

Sequence : while the series of challenges might imply a logical order, GMs should not expect or demand the players follow a specific sequence. As much as possible, present them with multiple choices at each juncture.

## Encounters

An adventure consists of several challenges the PCs must face while confronting its adversary. Each such challenge is called an encounter and can take many forms ( calming the villagers , crossing the underground river , fighting the Nolah ). A single encounter usually lasts briefly, often adjudicated through five-second rounds.

[�] Catalyst : how does the encounter start? Is it through chance ( ambushed by brigands while trekking to the cave ), or does it depend on the location ( when the PCs find the mineshaft, they may climb down )? Some encounters could conceivably take place at several different instances; the GM could withhold introducing them until an interesting moment.

[�] Test : what impediments do the PCs face in the encounter? Do they require a very specific skill (Folklore, Climbing, Lockcraft) or could the PCs undertake the challenge in several different ways ( calming the villagers through Charm , or cowing them with Intimidation)? While offering a variety of paths is common, sometimes even restricting the choices entertains creative players.

[�] Resolution : when does an encounter end? How is failure and success defined? This can be fairly obviouswhen the PCs descend to the bottom of the mineshaft . Most importantly, how do the possible resolutions of the present encounter affect future ones, and the adventure as a whole?

Vanquished (page 162): this term helps GMs determine when a combat encounter ends. Shock States, Impairment, and Morale can all lead to vanquished characters. While the Morale Roll table offers very specific results, the GM should also roleplay each NPC's own motives when determining how they ultimately react to conflict (fight on, surrender, or run away). What is uniquely at stake for an NPC to continue fighting?
