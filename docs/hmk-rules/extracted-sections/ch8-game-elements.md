# Game Elements

## Game Elements

Most participants enjoy playing HârnMaster over several gaming sessions, with the PCs facing a series of narratively related challenges that enable them to explore the setting more widely. These longer games are called campaigns , and they consist of three broad elements-adventures, nonplayer characters (NPCs), and character development. Even shorter, single-session games involve the first two.

Adventures (page 406): an adventure involves the PCs facing one or more separate challenges called encounters . A campaign consists of two or more sequential adventures.

Non-Player Characters (page 410): the people and creatures the PCs meet during an encounter are called non-player characters (NPC). The GM usually controls their actions.

Character Development (page 413): over the course of several adventures, PCs may improve skills, accumulate possessions, and modify their social influence.

## Kèthîran Campaigns

GMs and players should consider the following five key traits about both the canon setting of Kethira and the system of HârnMaster. While published materials reflect these characteristics, advice is given for how gamers can modify each of them for campaigns of their own liking.

## culture

The technology, demographics, and societies of Kethira closely reflect many medieval Terran cultures of the 9th to 14th centuries. While not perfectly analogous in details, their shared elements ground much of the game play in a broadly familiar, historically established realism.

Advice : some ideas offensive to our modern outlook-such as slavery-do appear on Kethira among many peoples of various cultures. Gaming groups can minimise or exclude such aspects from their adventures as they wish.

## economy

While great material wealth is found among the rare Kethiran elite, and continental trade networks do exist, the 'treasure hoard' trope common to some fantasy RPGs is less common here. In fact, actual coins are fairly rare, certainly in rural areas.

Advice : special bounties of logical origin are still possible ( the lost booty of viking raiders ; ancient artefacts ).

## wild lands

While monsters exist on Kethira, their contexts are usually reasonably explained to some extent ( Ivashu do not procreate but are esoterically made in some way not fully understood ). A stark divide exists between settlements and the dangerous

wilderness beyond them, as exemplified by the violent Gârgún of Hârn or the strange lællyn of Emelrene.

Advice : groups can easily increase the prevalence of strange entities, or even decrease or remove their impact.

## the mysteries

While mages are not uncommon, many magical effects, such as teleportation and mind control, are more limited, when even possible, than in other fantasy games. Kethiran gods do not directly grant priestly 'magic'.

Advice : the Advice &amp; Options section on pages 348-349 discusses how to augment or minimise the Mysteries.

## character power

HârnMaster produces a flatter PC progression-skills develop more slowly and to a point not far from their MLs at character generation. The 'power level' of adventures remains more consistent throughout an entire campaign, with PCs rarely able to take NPCs for granted.

Advice : groups can incorporate more forgiving or harsher Attribute generation; granting more or fewer Fate Points.
