# Miscellany

## miscellany

In addition to arms and armour, characters can acquire other types of possessions. To make items, see Success Value Tests (page 61) and the skill entries (pages 64-91).

## Gear

Characters use a wide range of gear during the campaign, from expedition equipment to craft items and tools. When armour is not worn, it is treated as 'gear', and its weight in pounds adds to other equipment when calculating Encumbrance (page 122 sidebar).

## Expedition Equipment

The following table collects the gear characters most frequently need for journeys and exploration.

skill (s) the	source	or	skill	used	to	make	the	item-Cookery	(Ck), Chandler	(Ch),	Glassworking	(G),	Herblore	(Hb),	Hideworking	(H), Lockcraft	(L),	Perfumery	(P),	Metalcraft	(M),	Textilecraft	(T).

Arrow bag : a linen or buckram bag, waterproofed with wax, and sealable with laces. A light wood-framed grid keeps arrows separated so their feathers are not crushed. Removing and stringing an arrow is a 1-round action.

Backpack : holds up to 30 lb of equipment; if properly packed, halve effective weight for Encumbrance.

Bandages : the clean &amp; dress treatment requires one bandage per Injury Level; the staunch treatment uses d6 bandages per Bloodloss Point (page 178).

Bedroll : without a bedroll, character must make an END SR to recover weariness fatigue after sleeping (Success recovers 10 fatigue; Failure recovers 5 fatigue).

Bedroll, heavy : same END SR as for having no bedroll (above); with heavy bedroll, avoid the END SR and increase AV by 1 in a Cold Hazard Roll (page 149 sidebar).

Blanket : increase AV by 1 in a Cold Hazard Roll (page 149 sidebar); no affect on weariness recovery after sleeping.

Cloak (Cloth) : increase AV by 1 in a Cold Hazard Roll (page 149 sidebar); this is in addition to its contribution as part of the suit's F-aspect calculation (page 133).

Cloak (Padded) : increase AV by 2 in a Cold Hazard Roll (page 149 sidebar); this is in addition to its contribution as part of the suit's F-aspect calculation (page 133).

Grappling hook : when throwing for distance, the hook and rope are treated as a non-aerodynamic object with a Base Range 15 feet (page 110). The hook catches on a CS or a Success (S) with an even-numbered ones die (2, 4, 6, 8).

Herbs, retail : for use in mundane concoctions; or for potions made with a Herblore SV test (page 74). Herb cost is one quarter of a potion's cost: M 4d, S 12d, G 120d.

Lantern : sheds light in a 30-foot radius; one-eighth pint of oil burns for four hours.

Potion (Mild, Strong, Great): mundane concoctions that come in vials and are ingested or applied as a poultice. See the Potions table (page 75) for a dozen sample kinds.

Quiver : open at one end and not waterproofed; removing and stringing an arrow is a 1-round action.

Rations : hard biscuits and jerky; remain edible for 10 days (standard) or 30 days (iron).

Rope : the 1" hemp and ½" silk ropes hold 1000 pounds; the ½" hemp holds 400 pounds; lengths other than 50 feet change weight and cost proportionally.

Surgery tools : required for the extraction and surgery treatments; includes needles and thread, knives and saw, cautery, and two arrow spoons (metal tools for extracting arrows), but not bandages (see above).

Tarpaulin : gives shelter from precipitation.

Tents : give shelter from precipitation and offer +2 AV bonus in a Cold Hazard (page 149).

Tinderbox : includes flint, firesteel, and tinder; an SV3 Survival Success Value test result is needed to light in 6d6 rounds (reduce by one die per star result); a knife used in place of the firesteel brings a -20 penalty to the test.

Torch : sheds light in a 20-foot radius; burns for one hour. Treat as a stick (page 100) when used to strike a target; for resulting flame impact, see page 121 sidebar.

## workshops

Crafters using the following skills usually must have access to a workshop to make their associated items:

| Alchemy   | Glassworking   | Metalcraft   |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| Brewing   | Hideworking    | Milling      |
| Ceramics  | Jewelcraft     | Weaponcraft  |
| Fletching | Masonry        | Woodworking  |

Player characters do not have to 'purchase' a workshop related to their occupational skill. Simply measure its Quality rating according to the crafter's Wealth rating:

| quality   | state     | wealth   | alchemy   |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
|          | makeshift | ≤ 4      | 10-12     |
|         | sparse    | 5-6      | 13-16     |
|        | standard  | 7-12     | 17-19     |
|       | plentiful | 13-16    | 20-29     |
|      | ideal     | 17+      | 30+       |

Alchemy : the esoteric nature of alchemical workshops demands more expensive equipment; use the Wealth shown in the alchemy column to determine Quality.

## mundane fire damage

Mundane fires are rated according to Fire size (FS), the same scale used to describe Peleahn seed fires and Fire Elementals. While they all roughly have the same temperature, larger fires generate more heat and so inflict greater burn impact.

|   fs | amount      | dia   | example    | target   | impact   |
|------|-------------|-------|------------|----------|----------|
|    0 | Scant       | 1"    | match      | Location | d4+2 f   |
|    1 | Trace       | 1'    | torch      | Location | d4+3 f   |
|    2 | Minor       | 3'    | campfire   | Location | d4+4 f   |
|    3 | Substantial | 10'   | large fire | Area     | d4+5 f   |
|    4 | Great       | 20'   | bonfire    | Area     | d4+6 f   |

Size : with sufficient dry fuel, fires increase by one FS every 30 seconds (6 rounds).

Target : fires strike at either an individual Location or as an Area Attack (Injury Sequence, page 167). If a Location, the Zone Die varies according to the source; ZD and LD might not be rolled at all (for instance, touching a flame automatically targets the Hand).

Impact : assumes a 1-round exposure; reduce Impact by 3 if shorter. For example, striking with a torch as a 1-turn action inflicts only d4 + 0 f impact. A Grab and hold (page 106) is required to do the full impact.

Smoke Inhalation : treat as Asphyxia (page 183) if the fire and smoke are in an enclosed area.

## gear encumbrance

For every 20 full pounds of properly stowed gear, a character accrues 5 Encumbrance : ENC0 up to 19 lb; ENC5 for 20 to 39 lb, and so on. This gear ENC is then added to armour ENC before applying the adjustment for Strength (page 112). For items that are poorly stowed, or awkward to carry, double their weight for making this determination.

Armour estimate : a suit of armour packed away weighs ten plus double its unadjusted ENC, in pounds. Thus, a mail habergeon suit weighs 30 lb as stowed gear (ENC10 × 2 + 10). A suit of clothing weighs 5 lb; heavy clothing, 10 lb. Weights of individual articles are also listed in the table on page 118 for players who wish to tally precisely the carried weight (the ENC result is very close to the estimated approach).

## mount encumbrance

For every 20 full pounds of weight carried, horses and bovines accrue 5 Encumbrance . This weight consists of rider(s), tack, and gear stowed in pack frames and saddlebags.

Mounts typically bear about 20 lb of tack, 30 lb if fitted with a war saddle. Saddle bags weigh 3 lb. Barding (horse armour) is thought not to be used anywhere on Lythia, and so no examples are given.

Bovines, horses, and camels have Personal Fatigue of 5 plus one-quarter their adjusted ENC (round fractions down to nearest 0 or 5). This differs from the PF formula for bipedal folk.

Example : a mounted character weighing 150 lb wears a 30-lb mail habergeon suit and carries 20 lb of weapons and gear (200 lb). She rides a courser warhorse bearing normal tack and saddle bags with 20 extra pounds of equipment (43 lb). The total weight borne by the horse is 243 lb, which imparts 60 ENC (20 full pounds twelve times; 12 × 5 = 60). The courser's STR27 has a -40 ENC modifier, bringing the modified ENC down to 20. This lowers the horse's Move to 130 and gives it PF10 (5 + [¼ × 20]).

## camels

Often found in markets of Hepekeria or among the Besha nomads, camels are used as both pack and riding animals. They can bear much more weight than horses, accruing 5 ENC for every 40 full pounds carried.

## elephants

Rarely seen in Venarive beyond Anzeloria, elephants can be trained but are always considered wild, not domesticated (see Animal Control, page 65). A harness and wooden platform, together costing 480d and weighing 200 pounds, can hold a drover and three archers (page 356). Elephants accrue 5 ENC per 8 0 full pound s carried.

## Conveyance

Most people travel by foot; wealthier folk, traders, and soldiers often ride or drive beasts. Many cultures also employ sailing and rowed vessels for coastal and river journeys and for the rare sea voyage.

## Beasts

Folk use beasts most often for work or travel. Below are several types from the horse family, as well as other animals trained for special tasks, such as dogs and hawks.

| beast         | mb price   | beast                 | mb price   |

## vehicles &amp; tack

Equine and camel mounts require bit and bridle, a horse blanket, and a saddle; draft and pack animals use special harnesses. Multiply weight and price by five for elephant tack (see sidebar).

Cart : typically used with one ox pulling 2,500 lb, or one cart horse pulling 2,000 lb. Oxen induce one inherent Slow Mode in step 4 of the Trekking Routine (page 145).

Pack harness : allows pack animals to carry up to 20% of their body weight in properly stowed gear.

Saddle, war : custom made for each horse; the high cantle gives riders a +20 bonus on unseating Stumble Rolls (page 161 sidebar); mounting requires a Move action and a successful Control test (page 172).

Sled : typically used with one cart horse pulling 2,000 lb, or two cart horses pulling 3,000 lb, both at the Cart rate over snow (page 146).

Wagon : typically used with two oxen pulling 8,000 lb, or two cart horses pulling 6,400 lb. Oxen induce one inherent Slow Mode in step 4 of the Trekking Routine (page 145).

## Vessels

Throughout Venarive there are dozens of vessel designs that come in many different sizes for a variety of uses. See the Shipwright skill entry (page 84) for constructing them and the Seafaring section (page 151) for a simple routine to resolve voyages. Below is a sampling of ships and boatsthe Maritime Rules has an expanded offering.

Dak : a single-masted, square-sailed roundship that is the most popular merchant vessel in northern waters. First emerging in Shorkyne over 70 years ago, it is sometimes called the 'Shorka cog'. Larger versions have two masts.

<!-- image -->

Karúne : a revolutionary roundship appearing less than 30 years ago in Palithane and Trierzon. The Karune combines elements of the Dak and Raem, having a square-sailed mainmast and a venyn-triangular-mizzenmast (larger ones add a third, square foremast). There are only about sixty Karune in all of Venarive.

Kárvik : a shallow-drafted, single-masted roundship that can be slowly rowed if needed. The Karvik is popular with the Arlantan pirates of the southwestern waters of the Venarian Sea. The warriors aboard are lightly armed and armoured but usually have boarding melee experience.

Larú : a low, sleek galley propelled by a single-masted venyn sail. The Laru is the principal war vessel of the Venarian Sea. In battle, its 30 rowers can make short bursts of over 8 knots, seeking to grapple and board enemy ships. The version depicted here is a small patrol boat that avoids straying more than a day from shore. It rarely seeks direct engagement but has five archers aboard in defence; rowers are expected to fight, too.

Larúmar : the great merchant galley of the Venarian Sea, this medium-sized version has a single-masted venyn sail and a skeleton crew of rowers for manoeuvring in port. It carries ten archers for defence. The largest Laru-mar are triple-masted and protected by twenty warriors.

Nívik : a one-masted, square-rigged Ivinian roundship with no main deck, commonly seen throughout most waters of northwestern Venarive. Tarpaulins and canopies protect the crew and cargo. The version here is a coastal trader and fishing boat, but larger ones reach 60 feet in length and can regularly cross open seas.

Pínda : a small deckless boat common to all regions. The small Pinda here is often carried as a lifeboat aboard larger vessels. Oared or sailed, Pindas are also employed as fishing boats and tenders, but rarely roam even coastal waters for longer than half a day. If pressed into lifeboat duty, it has SIZ1, HUL1, and SKP0 (page 151).

Raém : the most popular roundship merchant vessel of the Venarian sea. The Raem carries two venyn-rigged masts for quite capable windward performance. While this also helps mitigate higher sea state dangers, the Raem must ultimately run before the wind in strong storms like all other vessels described here.

Tálbar : a shallow-drafted, low-freeboard river boat, popular throughout all Venarive. Single-masted but more often slowly rowed, the Talbar has a very unseaworthy SIZ2, HUL1, and SKP0 (page 151).

Vasérskåb : the most common Ivinian warboat. The smallest version given here is crewed by three dozen armed and mail-shirted warriors who also row and sail. Capable of entering shallow waters for raids, the Vaserskab's singlemasted square sail can propel it great distances at sea given a following and safe wind.

## crew costs

Sailor crewmembers ( s ) cost 2d per day; rowers ( r ) 1d per day; and warriors ( w ) either 2d per day if archers or 1d if common soldiers. The pilot takes 10d per day. Provisioning is 1d per crewmember per day.

## Structures

Architecture varies according to culture and climate. The following entries describe the various buildings and fortifications listed in the Standing table (page 52), applying mostly to the styles of northwestern Venarive.

Local Maps produced by Kelestia Productions, such as the portion of Burzyn in the Kingdom of Chybisa shown to the right, use a scale of 1 mm to 10 feet. The white buildings represent all manner of wattle and daub, wooden, and stone structures, with prominent stone edifices such as castles and walls shaded black. The buildings are kept a blank white to ease identification and to enable clear player notation and modification.

## Buildings

The cost to construct buildings listed in the Masonry and Woodworking skill entries in Chapter Three accounts for their outer shell, interior furnishings, and, if appropriate, land value. The following structure descriptions include the inhabitant's typical Wealth ( wlt ) and the building's basic, smaller-end dimension and number of floors. Alternate sizes and costs can be figured proportionally.

Hovel ( wlt 2-4; 10' × 20'; 1 floor): the walls are a lattice of wooden strips, called wattle, filled (or 'daubed') with sticky soil, clay, or sand mixture, all usually braced in a wooden frame and covered by a thatched roof. The floor is often packed earth-warmer than stone and cheaper than wood. The process and materials are the same for many cottages, below; a hovel is just smaller, most associated with serfs.

Cottage ( wlt 5-9; 20' × 20'; 1 floor): constructed as for a hovel, a cottage commonly includes a three-foot to tenfoot deep earth cellar covered by wooden floors. Cottages are home to freeholding farmers and some urban poor, although town dwellers very often live in single rooms or floors of larger tenement buildings.

Cottage, large ( wlt 10-16; 20' × 20'; 2 floors): a two-storey cottage housing wealthy farmers, yeomen, and crafters. In some locales, it could be a single-storey, all-stone construction. High in the Jerinalian Mountains, the tribal Emhle often dwell in stone 'lodges', some quite massive, and home to entire clans.

Townhouse ( wlt 15-19; 20' × 20'; 2 floors): usually halftimbered, with occasional one-foot thick stone walls, the typical townhouse eventually sags and leans with age. Only the wealthiest of townsfolk, such as the family of a guild leader ('syndic'), occupy an entire townhouse.

Tenement : most commonly, whole families occupy just one or two rooms on a single floor ( wlt 5-6) or, if better off, an entire floors consisting of several rooms ( wlt 7-9). Workshop : sometimes the front-facing ground floor room of a townhouse serves as a crafter's workshop,

<!-- image -->

with a section of its wall next to the entry door splitting horizontally up and down to allow for transactions with outside customers. The back room is often a store room, with the crafter and family living in the floor(s) above.

Townhouse, exclusive ( wlt 20-49; 20' × 20'; 3 floors): usually only the affluent, such as powerful gentry, live in all-stone townhouses. Having exterior walls one and halffeet thick, these exclusive townhouses often reach three or more storeys and include small attached gardens.

Typical Inn (30' × 60'; 3 floors): reflecting roughly the same cost and construction data as an exclusive townhouse, a common inn is usually much larger since it is rarely made entirely of stone. Rural inns along well-travelled routes can double further the above size (and proportional cost), not counting its several outbuildings and stable. When encircled by even a low wall, such inns nearly rival smaller manor houses as fortifications.

## furnishings

Both rich and poor dwellings made with the same materials look quite similar from the outside. Even interior furnishings remain sparse across most classes. Floors are usually covered in woven mats of rush (sturdy stalks of flowering plants), and the walls are often hung with linen cloth, sometimes dyed or embroidered.

Benches and long trestle tables, dismantled after meals, are common. Chests hold valuables and, in wealthier homes, cupboards display dishes and silver. In small cottages and apartments, the single main room used to cook and live in also serves as the bedroom. Furniture is pushed to the side, and most folk sleep on pallets or strawfilled mattresses, sometimes with partitions for privacy.

Lighting : hearth fires provide a great deal of an interior's illumination. Fitted oiled parchment or wood shutters in windows can block most sunlight (glass is rare even among the rich). Oil lamps are saved until complete darkness, and the candles of the wealthy are smoky and pungent. Rush plants soaked in tallow are the most common light source.

## Fortifications

While residential buildings such as large townhouses and inns can offer a measure of security, the defences of truly fortified structures are formidable. The entries below describe the fortifications of a feudal realm and those who dwell in them. The table to the right lists the principal shell's dimensions, the thickness of its stone walls (the third figure, from 2' to 7.5'), and the number of floors.

Manorhouse ( wlt 20-74): a manor is also called a 'knight's fee', the basic jurisdiction of the feudal system. A single enfeoffed knight, family members, and retainers live in a manorhouse not much larger than a townhouse, simply with thicker walls and sometimes within a courtyard surrounded by a palisade. A large great hall dominates the structure, with earth, wood, or stone floors and sparse furnishings similar to that of humbler dwellings.

Manorhouse, large : the size of the manorhouse often grows in relation to the manor's acreage (600 to 3,600). Wealthier knights can also afford 'scutage' (when rent replaces their personal military service) or 'substitution' (when yeomen or hired mercenaries serve in their stead).

Keep ( wlt 75-99): the domains of tenants-in-chief, such as barons, are comprised of a handful to dozens of smaller manors. Such greater nobles reside in massive keeps of several storeys with walls several feet thick. Typically, a full-time company of twenty men-at-arms guards the edifice. Its associated settlement usually has a population of several hundred people. Some keeps are not enfeoffed, but rather overseen by a sheriff appointed by the king.

Castle ( wlt 100+): the greatest feudal domains are held by earls and dukes. They include several vassal barons and up to 200 manors. Their castles have a primary military and political function, and the adjoining settlements can reach over a thousand inhabitants, becoming minor trade centres. The fortifications might be guarded by 40 men-atarms, plus the earl's personal force of household knights.

## Other Structures

Mill (10' × 15' to 15' × 20'; 1 floor): usually half-timbered with one-foot thick stone wall in parts, mills are built and owned by the Guild of Millers and Millwrights.

Palisade : a wall of one-foot thick tree trunks or wooden stakes driven into the ground, often sharpened at the top.

Stockade Tower (20' × 20'; 2 floors): a tower with wooden walls two feet thick, its floors connected by ladder.

Siege Weapons : machines small enough to be rolled on wheels hurl 50 lb stones through the release of a bent wooden arm (tension) or tightly wound cords (torsion). Larger engines are immobile once erected, but can throw boulders weighing several hundred pounds up to a thousand feet by way of counterweight and gravity.

Wall, stone : an eleven-foot tall, five-foot thick wall of stone filled with rubble. Adjust proportionally the costs and times on page 78 for different heights and thicknesses.

## Artefacts

Artefacts are items that express special, often wondrous effects. There are four types: arcane artefacts, Earthmaster objects, divine relics, and written works. Both alchemical elixirs and shamanic talismans are 'wondrous'; indeed, the former are enchantments that can be dispelled. However, elixirs and talismans have Temporary durations, whereas artefacts are always Indefinite or Permanent.

## arcane artefacts

Casting the Vessel spell on an object makes it an arcane artefact. A minor artefact contains one enchantment; a major artefact has two or more. The Artefact Creation Sequences (pages 256-257) explain how mages craft and enchant arcane artefacts and how others use them.

## Minor Artefacts

Sometimes called 'unary' artefacts by the Shek-Pvar, minor artefacts hold one enchantment. Several pieces of information are noted in the examples that follow.

Enchantment : the spell used to enchant the artefact. If only Convocation and Complexity Level are listed, then the spell is not detailed in the rules-its effects could be approximated through new spell research. Incanters often create unique spells for artefact enchantments or even research known spells anew to change them slightly to produce an idiosyncratic artefact effect.

Attunement : some minor artefacts require the user first to establish attunement with them (page 208).

Duration : the artefact can have either an Indefinite or a Permanent duration.

Effect : the enchantment expresses either a continuous or a latent effect. A continuous one might require attunement but never invocation-its effect is always active. A latent effect might need attunement but always requires invocation. This is a 1-turn Incant action that demands no test but expends one charge.

Charges : the maximum number of charges a latent enchantment can carry, followed in parentheses by a dice array for generating randomly the charges remaining. A mage can cast the Charge spell (Neutral II) to replenish Permanent artefacts (but not Indefinite ones).

Invocation : if a minor artefact does not require attunement, then the invoker activates it by saying a key word while touching it. This can be nonsensical gibberish or from an actual language, often an ancient one. The key word might be etched into the artefact itself. Mages can also uncover it by casting a CS Reveal spell (Neutral I).

## alva's jug

A glazed ceramic half-gallon jug decorated with embossed horizontal spirals. When invoked with the key word 'Harken', the jug's enchantment records the surrounding noise for the next hour. It hears things as a typical human would-far-off sounds might be faint and indecipherable; nearby speech would be clearer. The jug keeps recording the surrounding environment even while being moved.

A second utterance of the key word while touching the jug stops the recording (if it hasn't already stopped after an hour), and it replays what had been heard. Anyone touching it, even unattuned characters, hear the sounds at the same volume and from the same relative perspective as the jug recorded them (a 360° effect). The replay does not use a charge but does erase the recording as it goes along.

Enchantment: (Lyahvi III)

Attunement: No

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Latent

## boots of túrentan

Grey leather boots. These 'elven boots' grant an attuned wearer a +20 to ML (and maximum ML) in Climbing, Stealth, and orienteering tests of Survival. During step 3 of the Minor Artefact Creation Sequence, an elven mage using Faeriecraft must succeed on a Spirit SR along with the successful Casting Roll, or the enchantment fails.

Enchantment: (Fyvria IV) with Faeriecraft

Attunement: Yes

Charges: -

Duration: Permanent

Invocation: -

Effect: Continuous

## collar of kartán

A 24-inch long, narrow strip of soft leather with a small silver clasp on one end. When the invoker clasps it around something 7 inches or less in diameter and utters the key word 'Kartan-ah', the collar constricts, expending one charge. After six cumulative constrictions, the collar completely cuts through any substance. Around someone's neck, each constriction imparts a mounting b -aspect Injury Level (M1 b after one, S2 b after two, and so forth). The victim makes a Shock Roll with each new constriction, perhaps dying before the sixth's decapitation.

Uttering the key word 'Kartan-dor' expends one charge and causes it to expand, loosening one constriction. The collar must be completely loosened in this way in order to unclasp the two ends. For instance, three constrictions require three loosenings to unclasp it (six total charges).

Enchantment: (Neutral V)

Attunement: No

Duration: Indefinite

Effect: Latent

Charges: 24 (3d6)*

Invocation: Key Word

'Kartán-ah; -dor'

*Round odd-numbered charges up to next even number, unless the collar is found clasped around something.

Charges: 21 (3d6)

Invocation: Key Word

## enchanted armour

An enchanted article of metal armour, usually a mail byrnie, or plate cuirass or helm. Armour Value in protected locations increases by 3 in all aspects.

Enchantment: Armour (Jmorvi V)

Attunement: No

Charges: -

Duration: Permanent

Invocation: -

Effect: Continuous

## enchanted weapon

An enchanted melee weapon, usually a sword. Impact in all aspects increases by 3. It may strike creatures not normally affected by mundane weapons, such as Asiri.

Enchantment: Anvil (Jmorvi III)

Attunement: No

Charges: -

Duration: Permanent

Invocation: -

Effect: Continuous

## fount of power

A Fount of Power usually takes the guise of an elemental object according to its maker's Convocation. A typical one holds a maximum of 40 points (2d4 × 5 when found). An attuned character can use them instead of accruing windedness or weariness fatigue or to remove fatigue during recovery. Any mage can replenish the points by casting Charge (Neutral II). The rarer Indefinite Founts are called Periapts of Power and cannot be replenished.

Enchantment: Fount (Neutral III)

Attunement: Yes

Charges: -

Duration: Permanent

Invocation: -

Effect: Continuous

## mask of hesitation

An extremely distorted and angry face carved in wood. An attuned user holding the mask invokes it by suddenly presenting it in the LOS of a target within 10 feet. This expends one charge and forces the target to Ignore its next defence or to Pass on its next turn (whichever comes first). Targets in the process of a multi-round action must cease it, but they may defend normally and take action on their next turn. If presented the Mask a subsequent time, the target resists the effect with a successful Spirit test.

Enchantment: (Savorya II)

Attunement: Yes

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Latent

## rune objects

Runemasters infuse objects with arcane energy by engraving runes into their surface. They become Indefinite arcane artefacts that enable attuned characters to benefit from their effects. See the Runecraft section (page 281) for descriptions.

## pebbled shroud of harávanàl

A stone-coloured cloak covered in dozens of small rocks spaced several inches apart. The Shroud weighs five pounds and when worn has a b 1 e 2 p 1 f 2 Armour Value in the back Torso zone. Attuned characters who don and activate it expend a charge and turn to stone for up to ten hours (duration specified at invocation). In stone form, characters weigh five times their normal weight and cannot physically or sensorially interact with the surroundings or speak, but they do retain mental functions. For instance, a character can test Trance to inhabit their soul or invoke Clairvoyance to 'look around'but can neither see nor cast a spell requiring touch.

Enchantment: modified Petrification (Fyvrian VI)

Attunement: Yes

Charges: 30 (5d6) Invocation: -

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Latent

## staff of gloom

A white five-foot long staff of smoothly crafted holly heartwood. An attuned character invokes the Gloomweb spell at the cost of one charge. The effect (page 246) is in a 40-foot radius around the invoker. The area may also be anchored in place to a point the invoker touches, and up to eight creatures the invoker touches may be excluded from its effect. The Gloomweb lasts two minutes (24 rounds).

Enchantment: Gloomweb (Odivshe V)

Attunement: Yes

Charges: 28 (4d6)

Duration: Permanent

Invocation: -

Effect: Latent

## veil of nàthatâra

A finely made linen veil. Attuned wearers lower it over their face to invoke it. At the cost of one charge, their facial features, skin, and hair colour then change to a fictitious, imagined person. Upon lifting the Veil, the invoker makes a Creativity test: any failure means the new, revealed face has a flaw that a viewer might notice with a successful Awareness test. The change lasts eight hours or until the invoker lowers and then raises the Veil over the new face.

Enchantment: lesser variant of Mask (Neutral III)

Attunement: Yes

Charges: 24 (3d6)

Duration: Permanent

## Major Artefacts

Major-or 'compound'-artefacts contain two or more enchantments. Arcanists have discovered that multiple enchantments require a focused, driving force for stability, either artificially created (Ego) or imported from a natural source (Will). Major artefacts are described by most of the characteristics used to define minor artefacts (page 126), but there are a few important distinctions.

Volition : the artefact's driving force-called volition-is created with one of three Neutral spells: False Soul (III), Investment (V), or Personality (VI). They all can create Ego; the latter could instead install a being's Will.

Attunement : major artefacts always require attunement to invoke their latent enchantments. High-volition artefacts can even force attunement on someone (page 209).

Morality &amp; Purpose : artefacts whose volition is created with the Investment spell can have Morality and Purpose. The artefact can attempt to dominate attuned characters who act in opposition to its outlook (page 209). Natural personality artefacts always have Morality and Purpose, so contrary attuners always risk such domination.

Invocation Roll : major artefacts never use charges to power latent enchantments; instead, an attuned character makes a Major Artefact Invocation Roll by testing Spirit (page 257). This represents the invoker compelling the artefact's Ego or Will to express the enchantment effect.

## censer of zerûla

Named after the large port city of Dalkesh, home to the greatest Peleahn Chantry in all of Venarive, this five-hundred-year-old, six-inch tall, gold-plated brass trapezoidal pot dangles from three twelve-inch chains. When a fire is lit within it, an attuned character holding it receives +20 bonus to Casting Rolls with Peleahn spells and a similar +10 bonus with Jmorvi and Lyahvi spells. The Censer also has a 50-point Fount, which the attuned may draw from in place of fatigue, either when it is accrued or during recovery (windedness and weariness only).

The Censer of Zerula has made its way across Venarive as a gift to many successive chantries and courts. Mages from Dalkesh now seek to recover it after discovering a Neramic papyrus from the time of the sorcerer-emperor Kereshna. Its writing contains a cipher expressly keyed to the filigree design around the sides of the pot-the message will remain a mystery without recovering the censer.

## ilp´ylen reaver

A finely crafted five-foot sword with crimson-hued fullers, the Ilpylen Reaver was made over two hundred years ago by the eponymous Jmorvi mage-priest as an award for the victorious arena combatant during a Feast of Balefire. The bastard sword has +2 WQ and +1 impact from its crafting, and +2 impact and +15 bonus to Melee tests from enchantments. Reaver's blade also glows fiery orange when Ivashu come within 700 feet, becoming more vibrant the closer and more numerous they are. Strikes against Ivashu have their impact increased by a further 2.

An attuned wielder tests Spirit to invoke the latent Gauntlet enchantment (step 5, page 257). If successful, tendrils of ethereal fire swathe Reaver's blade. Each invocation brings a pool of 7 points . When the blade strikes or even taps someone, the invoker may spend 1 point to inflict an Ethereal Burn that forces the target to make a SHK 7 Shock Roll (2 points force a SHK 8). An injury resulting from the strike itself is resolved before the shock caused by Gauntlet. The enchantment becomes latent again once all seven points are spent.

Reaver's purpose is to champion the violent designs of Agrik and to slaughter Ivashu, whether in the field or in the arena. With steeled resolve, the artefact can force and maintain this purpose even with resisting wielders, although its guiltless and opportunistic outlook could repel those of purer heart.

Takara al Kesalenes, the cruel high priest of the Agrikan temple in Chelemby city, consecrated and presented Reaver a few years ago to Haken al Bredyn, her lover and sadistic commander of the Order of the Demon Pameshu the Insatiable. While the public arena games are muted to suit the city's 'civilised' sensibility, the private, monthly ceremonies remain bloody and ghastly. The rival Laranians have long known of Reaver and might support a plan to steal it.

MISCELLANY

## earthmaster objects

The Earthmasters vacated Kethira about 15,000 years ago. Much of the evidence for their civilisation is found in their strange artefacts left behind. These Earthmaster objects function similarly to arcane items but with a seemingly organic quality. They remain indecipherable beyond the broadest understanding of all except the wisest mage.

Characters may attempt two actions with Earthmaster objects: Concurrence and Use. Called Operation Rolls, both tasks can leave users quite winded:

When used, one master object

Concurrence : using an Earthmaster object first requires concurrence, achieved by the character touching it for one round in concentration and then making a Spirit test as a free action. Succeeding in the test imparts concurrence and an intuitive knowledge of the object's effect and lasts even without touching it. Characters lose concurrence if they suffer Aural Shock, after which they must repeat the action to reestablish it.

Use : concurred characters may then attempt to use an Earthmaster object by making a 1-turn Spirit (Creativity) test (touch is usually required). Only one person may actively use the object, though several might be concurred.

Charges : most Earthmaster objects carry a number of charges which are expended when successfully used. Failed tests to use them do not expend charges. The number of charges found in one can be determined by rolling the dice indicated in square brackets after its name. A few objects do not function on charges at all-they can be used simply with an Operation Roll.

Recharging : aside from Earthmaster objects that recharge other Earthmaster objects, only a Grey Mage casting the Charge spell (Neutral II) can replenish them.

Repairing : the only known way to repair an Earthmaster object that is not functioning is by using an AndarinWysan (below).

What follows are the descriptions of several Earthmaster objects. The Godstones (page 154) are also powerful examples. When designing others, GMs should have them impart an alien, perhaps bizarre quality. Each one should be singularly unique, and, while such 'new' Earthmaster objects can be found throughout Kethira, no esotericist has yet been able to create or replicate one.

## affecting earthmaster objects

Dispel (Neutral II) and the Negation arcane talent have no effect on Earthmaster objects. Except for a grey mage's Charge spell, their enigma places them in most ways beyond the tripartite Mysteries. Their material is often made of the grey substance dubbed pseudostone , utterly resistant to physical harm.

## andârin-w´ysan [5d20]

A small, grey, semi-transparent egg. When used, one charge is expended and the Andarin-Wysan completely recharges one other designated Earthmaster object in contact with it. If the object is not functioning, the Andarin-Wysan also repairs it with a successful d10 roll versus TN5 at the cost of 3 extra charges (failed repairs do not expend charges). An Andarin-Wysan cannot itself be recharged.

## eye of ígjar

A large moonstone in a silver setting. With successful operation, the user holding it can look through the pendant at a Godstone or the portal of a Gate spell and view the gateway's destination for one round. The viewer's perspective is the same as if standing at the destination looking straight ahead (to see accurately at the user's natural periphery might require a successful Perception test). Using an Eye of Igjar does not expend charges.

## fortress-box of alakáth [2d6]

A 15-inch white cube that weighs 20 pounds when empty. A successful use expends one charge and has the box unfold into a 15-foot cube with one side's top edge seamlessly hinged (this side can be swung open from its opposite edge). The box holds any objects or beings that can fit, but the total weight increases accordingly.

A second Operation Roll expends a charge and refolds the box to its smaller size, sealing it closed. Objects and people inside remain in stasis, free of erosion, ageing, and trauma. Beings are conscious but may not speak to each other; their souls are dormant in the spirit world. The weight of the small Fortress-box is the same: 20 pounds plus its content weight. Characters may only gain concurrence to the box from the outside but may use it from within if they were already concurred.

## hooded robe of nonbeing [2d6]

A sleeved, hooded robe of an unknown supple and light grey material ( av 2 in all aspects). Concurred wearers who pull the hood up and wrap their crossed arms around their torso may attempt a longer-than-usual 3-round Operation Roll. With success, they dematerialise for 10 minutes per charge expended, the number announced before the test.

## likîrlw´ysan [5d20]

A slim, silver, metallic egg five inches long. A successful user holding the object can impart a five-second telepathic message into it and then immediately have the egg teleport to within five feet of a designated target who is also concurred to it. The Likirlwysan arrives in 2d6 rounds (S) or in one round (CS), even between worlds. At the destination, it hovers nearby until the target also makes an Operation Roll, whereupon it transmits the message telepathically (no common language required). Each operation by either party expends one charge.

## nagârith [5d20]

A bowl of pure white jade. When filled with water, the Nagarith removes all Psyche Stress levels from a successful user touching it (one charge per PSY ) . It also removes Psyche traits (one charge each), impulses (two charges each) and disorders (three charges each). With a CS, the user has other-worldly visions that impart a one-use pool of Fate Points equal to the charges spent. These work independently of the user's own FP amount (page 280).

Someone without a Psyche Trait who attempts and fails concurrence acquires 4 Psyche Stress Levels and one random indefinite impulse (CF indefinite disorder).

## prism of soul stealing

## [5d6]

A cut gem with many facets, usually a diamond, emerald, ruby, or sapphire. When operated, the user holding it targets a living being within 10 feet and LOS. If the user's roll exceeds the success level of a Spirit test made by the target (break ties), then the target's body is teleported into one of the gem's facets (a willing target does not have to resist). A given Prism can only ever hold up to d6 × 2 beings at once, regardless of the number of actual facets. One charge is expended with each successful operation, regardless of whether the target resists or not.

Once within, targets are kept in stasis in their own separate facet, free from harm, but suffering indefinite Aural Shock . A user may release a captured target with another successful Operation Roll at no charge cost. The target then reappears at their normal size within 10 feet of the Prism, completely recovered from the Aural Shock.

## rod of scintillating doom [5d6]

A metallic rod about 30 inches long. A successful user holding it can send forth from its tip a pencil-thin beam of burning coherent light out to a point up to 200 yards away. Each operation expends one charge and allows the beam to burn through two feet of wood, a foot of stone, or six inches of metal in one round. The beam usually passes through living entities without affecting them. However, the user has the option to allow the beam to injure any living entity it passes through during the round, doing d4 + 12 f impact with ZD d10 to each target in the beam's path. This costs one additional charge per struck target.

<!-- image -->

## sh´yven's eye [5d6]

A translucent orb about an inch and a half in diameter. When it is touched to the forehead and successfully operated at the cost of one charge, the user activates the Eye (its appearance remains the same). Then, when users close their eyes, they see through the Eye, no matter where it is placed. The user can continue the effect at the cost of one charge per day without a new Operation Roll-or end the effect as a free action at any point.

On a CF Operation Roll, the user sees images of other worlds and strange places, acquiring one Psyche Stress Level for each level of Aural Shock initially suffered.

## ward of shonjôr-kalím [5d20]

A 12-inch long, half-inch diameter translucent rod. When it is touched and successfully operated at the cost of one charge, the user activates the Ward. The active rod, when held or laid somewhere, prevents creatures other than the user from approaching within 25 - WIL feet of it (based on the creature's Will). The user can continue the effect at the cost of one charge per day without a new Operation Rollor end the effect as a free action at any point.

## web of shâlot [5d20]

A grey cone about a foot and a half tall with a six-inch base, made of pseudostone , the same material comprising Godstones. The Web of Shalot weighs 20 pounds. When successfully operated at the cost of one charge (the user simply need be within Spirit ML feet of it), the cone generates an extradimensional sphere centred on its tip with a radius in feet equal to the user's Aura.

The Web takes one round to form; then no entity can enter or leave the sphere. The effect passes through and ignores entities too large to fit entirely within the sphere, such as tall trees or enormous creatures. Occupants can see through it, but the surface is mirror-like to those outside. The Web lasts one day; the user can continue it without a new Operation Roll at the cost of one charge per each additional day. A successful user touching it from the outside can end the effect as a free action at any point.

## relics

Relics are objects infused with divine favour, sometimes produced at the moment of death of a character possessing Grace (page 311). The living cannot craft true relics, any more than they can demand Grace-only the enigmatic Lesser Gods/aspects (page 309) may anoint relics. Not everyone in a state of Grace at death engenders a relic, and some items presented as relics by religious leaders, whether through cynicism or misplaced faith, might not actually be one.

In game terms, relics do not 'hold' points of Grace that others can use. Rather, the object becomes the focal point of an ordeal (page 318) that can bestow Grace upon those who fulfil its related feat, such as completing a pilgrimage to the relic's location, or undertaking a quest to uncover a lost or stolen relic.

## Relic Generation

While GMs can simply designate relics, they can also follow these steps to determine whether characters, perhaps a beloved PC or important NPC, who possessed Grace while alive, have catalysed a relic at death.

[�] Subject : the moment a character with Grace dies, the GM makes three d10 rolls against a TN equal to the character's total Grace. If all three rolls succeed, the associated Lesser God/aspect has anointed the articles and remains of the departed as relics.

[�] Relic Magnitude : designated relics are categorised as having minor, substantial, or great magnitude, according to the level of intimacy with the departed character, or some other criterion of importance for objects the GM simply designates as a relic.

Minor : objects routinely touched by the character, such as commonly worn clothing or jewellery-but not simply a chair once sat in.

Substantial : articles especially employed by the character, like a warrior's spear or a crafter's hammer, or places or buildings resided in.

Great : items directly associated with the character's significant exploits, such as a weapon used in a momentous battle. Sizeable physical remains, like a skull or skeleton, can also be great relics, but the smaller the piece, the more reduced its magnitude.

[�] Ordeal : a relic becomes the pivotal aspect of the feat required for completing an ordeal, usually a special type of pilgrimage called veneration . The devotee must travel to be in the relic's physical presence, to see or touch it. GMs can devise special circumstances surrounding the ordeal, according to details of the relic, but, otherwise, follow the five regular steps on page 318. The Ordeal Magnitude usually equals the Relic Magnitude.

Relic veneration must be conscious on the part of devotees-its reward should not come about trivially or by happenstance or against their consent. A character who worships a religion whose god is associated with a different aspect than the one who imparted the divine favour in the relic might be restricted.

Characters usually may only ever enjoy the benefits of completing the genuine veneration ordeal once per lifetime , no matter how many times they literally visit the given relic. Since relics are such overt sources of possible Grace, GMs might consider making the d20 Ordeal rolls secretly, even for PC devotees.

## saints

Canonisation is a worldly, church declaration, independent of whether the saint possessed Grace in life. However, a religion that recognises an object as a relic, whether true or not, often canonises the associated person.

## religious objects

In the game a sacred object , as described in the Consecration rules (page 320), is different than a relic . Although many revered relics are, indeed, also consecrated as sacred objects by clergy, consecration itself is more widespread, even more routine, than the veneration of relics. Also note that followers sometimes revere arcane artefacts . Thus, a given religious object could be: sacred object, relic, arcane artefact, or a combination of the three-or none of them (a counterfeit, whether witting or not).

## relic examples

Relics can take many forms. Here are three examples based upon faiths of the West Venarian pantheon (page 321):

Ágrik : the sword known as the Ilpylen Reaver (pages 128 and 258) could have been made a great relic upon the death of either its maker, Laena, or a famous Agrikan warrior who wielded it. The feat associated with fulfilling its ordeal could involve slaying Ivashu, rather than simply venerating it in person.

Laráni : in the third century tr , the second pontiff of the church, Saint Janasyn, issued the Guardian Decree, the writ that established the concept of the Laranian temple warrior. The scroll itself is revered as a great relic , but is not usually displayed publicly at the seat in Tengela, Trierzon. The saint's remains have not survived, but the quills he purportedly used in the writ's signing have been missing since Dasyn's Rebellion ( tr 596tr 598). They are revered as substantial relics .

Siém : some of the few especially dedicated humans who worship Siem are called Inthiar. One recent such Jarin 'priestess' was Doiryna, martyred in tr 658 during the early years of the Ivinian conquest in northern Hârn. She fought from hiding near what is now Marby and, while no possessions or literal trace of her survive, she became an inspiration during the Jarin rebellion over 40 years later. Today, members of the secretive Uthriem Roliri (pages 341 sidebar) undertake a pilgrimage to the very mountain spring she was said to have tapped during her struggle against the Ivinians. A small cairn and pool there are revered ( substantial relic ).

## written work scope

A written work is either a short missive , such as a dispatch, letter, or note that simply communicates a message; or a longer text ( tract , treatise , or disquisition) meant to expound on a subject, such as a history or grimoire. This table gives their typical lengths in pages, time to complete, maximum Insight stars, and base cost to produce (parchment, ink, and binding).

| scope        |   pages | time    |   insight | cost   |
|--------------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Missive      |       1 | 10min   |         0 | 3d     |
| Tract        |       8 | 5 days  |         1 | 30d    |
| Treatise     |      32 | 1month  |         3 | 120d   |
| Disquisition |     128 | 4months |         5 | 360d   |

Missives can be literally longer-use text scope for pages, time, and cost, but 0 Insight. Text sale value equals 50% ( tract ), 100% ( treatise ), or 150% ( disquisition ) more than their listed costs.

## written work insight

GMs can use Insights as special pieces of information to further the campaign narrative, not dissimilar to the function of Gather Information rolls (page 140). They can be treated quantitatively (each star equals one detail), hierarchically (lower star Insights are easier to uncover than higher ones), or through a combination of both. For instance, a treatise's three-star Insight could mean there are three special details a reader can find; or, instead, it provides a single, difficult clue that only a minimum three-star reading uncovers.

## reading sv modifier

Older texts are more likely to have suffered damage that could compromise the reader's Language (Script) SV test (page 83). To randomly determine this condition, roll on the column that corresponds to the era when the work was authored-ancient ( bt 1300bt 301), middle ( bt 300tr 500), or modern (since tr 501). Unless materials are especially inferior, a newly scribed work is considered pristine .

| ancient   | middle   | modern   | condition   |   sv |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------------|------|
| 01-05     | 01-25    | 01-35    | pristine    |    0 |
| 06-30     | 26-75    | 36-85    | degraded    |   -1 |
| 31-00     | 76-00    | 86-00    | damaged     |   -2 |

## poetics

When writing literature, such as poems and plays, authors use Language for Subject Index, and Creativity (Folklore SR) as the SV test. With music, composers use Musician skill for Subject Index, and Creativity (Folklore SR) as the SV test. Insight measures aesthetic quality.

## written works

Written works take a variety of forms-wax tablet, scroll, tapestry-and express a wide range of content-map, poem, edict. Whether detailing a timely message penned by desperate PCs or an ancient tome made by an obscure sage, follow this Writing Routine to create a written work.

## Writing Routine

These rules imply loose scrolls or bound books, where each 10" × 14" page is one-fourth of a 20" × 28" sheet of parchment or vellum. GMs can use this proportion to estimate coverage of works in other media and sizes.

[�] Language : authors select the Language and Script used to express the work, and whether they scribe it themselves or dictate it (step 6).

[�] Scope : the author designates the intent as either a missive or a text . A missive is just a brief message, whereas a text expounds at more length on a particular subject, usually meant to edify.

Text Length : when writing a text, authors further select one of three special scopes, each of increasing lengthtract , treatise , or disquisition (see sidebar table; randomise page counts up to ±20% if desired).

Subject Index : when writing a text, authors designate a Subject Index equal to the Index they have in the specific skill that reflects the subject matter, such as Masonry , Archery , or-a common defaultFolklore .

[�] Time : the author spends the time creating the written work, as given in the sidebar table. For texts, such time assumes a maximum of 10 hours work each day. Randomise the final time up to ±20% if desired.

[�] Test : upon completion, the author makes a Language (Creativity SR) Success Value test. Increase SV by � if the Creativity SR succeeds.

sv language (creativity sr) skill value test

≤ 2 limited : a brief missive is	completed	(up	to	several	halting	phrases).	Longer missives and texts are	not	finished,	but	the	author	may	try	again.

3-4 basic : a simple missive is	completed	(up	to	a	page).	Longer missives and texts are	not,	but	the	author	may	try	again	in	half	the time given	in	the	sidebar.

Critical Failure : whatever	the	resulting	SV,	the	author	makes	a Will test.	A	failure increases	the	time	to	complete	the	work	by	50%	(F)	or	100%	(CF).

[�] Insight : no matter the d10 results in step 4, a text's final Insight stars are limited either by its scope (sidebar table) or to no more than the author's Subject Index minus four, whichever is lower. For more on the effect of written work Insight, see sidebar.

[�] Scribing : authors either scribe their own work as they create it, or dictate it to another person as they go (dictation increases writing time by 50%). The appropriate party now makes the Scribing roll (page 83) to gauge a completed work's legibility and to determine the final, adjusted completion time.

Rewrites : authors may rewrite a completed text to improve it effectively only when either their Language or Subject skill has increased by 10 ML.
