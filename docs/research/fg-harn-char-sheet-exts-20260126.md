**Latest Information on Fantasy Grounds Custom Character Sheet Extensions (Open Source/GitHub) and HârnMaster/HARN/Hârn World Rulesets/Extensions:**

### Open Source Custom Character Sheet Extensions on GitHub
No exact matches for a general-purpose "open source custom character sheet extension" specifically branded as such on GitHub. However, Fantasy Grounds (FG) extensions are Lua/XML-based, and the community shares many open-source projects via the **Fantasy Grounds Unofficial Developers Guild** (https://github.com/FG-Unofficial-Developers-Guild), which hosts 85+ repos for ruleset mods, tools, and sheet enhancements. Key relevant open-source GitHub repos include:

- **MeAndUnique/CapitalGains** (https://github.com/MeAndUnique/CapitalGains): Adds a "Resources" section to PC/NPC character sheets for custom resource management. Actively maintained, open source.
- **jawillia/Siefer-DnD4e-fg-class-extension-** (https://github.com/jawillia/Siefer-DnD4e-fg-class-extension-): DnD 4e extension; drag classes to character sheets to auto-populate. Supports sheet integration.
- **drplote/FG-2e-PlayersOption** (https://github.com/drplote/FG-2e-PlayersOption): AD&D 2e extension with Player's Option rules; modifies PC sheet "Actions" tab with house rules/toggles.
- **kmheffernan/SD2FG-Converter** (https://github.com/kmheffernan/SD2FG-Converter): Converts Shadowdark RPG sheets to FG format; handles partial char sheet imports (manual tweaks needed).
- **theoldestnoob/fg-item-generator** (https://github.com/theoldestnoob/fg-item-generator): Procedural XML generator for items usable in CoreRPG/MoreCore sheets.
- Other notables: **walkerbrianpatrick/fgcontentforge** (content generator for sheets), **BeeGrinder/FantasyGrounds-SW5e** (5e mod with sheet tweaks), **SoxMax/FG-Path-of-War-Enhancements** (Pathfinder sheet adds).

**MoreCore** (a foundational extension for generic/custom rulesets with flexible char sheets) isn't directly on GitHub but has many derivatives (e.g., mesfoliesludiques/morecore-urban-shadows). Tutorials for building custom sheets exist on FG forums (e.g., extending CoreRPG: https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?23088-Character-sheet-how-to-make-a-simple-one-extended-from-CoreRPG).

FG's **Forge** (https://forge.fantasygrounds.com/) hosts free/paid .ext files; many are open for inspection but not always GitHub-hosted.

### HârnMaster/HARN/"Hârn World" Fantasy Grounds Rulesets/Extensions
No open-source GitHub repos found for Hârn-specific FG extensions/rulesets (searches returned zero direct hits). Community efforts are shared via FG forums and Forge as .ext attachments/modules. These include **custom character sheets** tailored to HârnMaster's d100 mechanics, skills, combat, etc. Key projects:

- **HârnMaster 3.5E Ruleset** (latest, most active):
  - Developer: Mephisto (with Columbia Games permission).
  - Release: Early access beta, announced July 24, 2025 (as of Jan 2026, 2 forum pages, 18 replies, 1,658 views; last post by Mangudai).
  - For FG Unity; features custom char sheet, skill rolls (some bugs reported, e.g., skill roll errors).
  - Available: FG Forums (https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?85452-HârnMaster-3-5E) with attachment; listed on Forge shop (https://forge.fantasygrounds.com/shop/items/?search=harnmaster).
  - Status: Beta; excited community response for HârnWorld support.

- **HârnMaster 3 Ruleset (built on MoreCore)**:
  - Developer: GunnarGreybeard (2019).
  - Custom implementation on MoreCore base (flexible sheets); incomplete but functional for core rules.
  - Forum: https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?50103-HârnMaster-3-Ruleset-(built-on-MoreCore); 2 pages, attachments.
  - Older discussions (2017-2020) mention 13th Age/RoleMaster hybrids or MoreCore tweaks for Hârn.

Other Hârn mentions: Forums desire full rulesets (e.g., lethal combat); no official SmiteWorks support. Check FG Rulesets forum (https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?92-Rulesets) for updates—HârnMaster 3.5E is pinned/recent.

**Recommendations:**
- Download via FG Forge (free tier available) or forum attachments (requires FG Unity license).
- For custom sheets: Start with MoreCore/CoreRPG, follow FG wiki/tutorials (https://fantasygroundsunity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FGCP/pages/996641917/5E+Character+Sheet).
- GitHub for dev: Fork Unofficial Guild repos; no Hârn ports yet—community opportunity.
- Latest as of Jan 26, 2026: HârnMaster 3.5E beta is the go-to; monitor forums for v1.0.
